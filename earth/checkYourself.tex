\begin{exercise}
  The Sun's rays are ``parallel'' because:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item It was at solar noon.
  \item The Sun is very far from the Earth.
  \item Alexandria and Aswan are in the Tropics.
  \item The Sun doesn't move with respect to the Earth.
  \item All of the above.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Eratosthenes' estimate is too large because:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The pace was imprecise.
  \item The angle was wrong.
  \item Aswan is not directly South of Alexandria. 
  \item The Earth is not a sphere.
  \item All of the above.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise}
  True or False: If you are standing on the equator of the Earth, you are actually traveling at around $1000$ miles per hour.

\begin{exercise}
 You find yourself on a planet like Earth, but the size is very different. 
 
 On the longest day of summer the Sun is directly above your city, there are no shadows and light reaches the bottom of even the deepest open wells.

Your friend lives in a city $500$ miles directly North of you. Here is a schematic diagram of a stick and a shadow in your friend's city:
  \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}[x=.5cm, y=.5cm]
        \coordinate (A) at (0,0);
        \coordinate (B) at (0,9.7);
        \coordinate (C) at (2,0);
        \tkzDrawSegment (A,B)
        \tkzDrawSegment (A,C)
        \tkzDrawSegment (C,B)

        \tkzMarkAngle[mark=,size=1.2cm,thin](A,B,C)
        \tkzLabelAngle[left, pos=2](A,B,C){$\theta^\circ$}
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    On this planet, the angle $\theta^\circ$ is \textbf{much smaller}  than it would otherwise be on Earth.
     
The circumference of the planet is:
\begin{enumerate}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\item Larger than the Earth.
\item Smaller than the Earth.
\end{multicols}
 \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
