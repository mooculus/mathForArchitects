  Around $100$ BCE, \link[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes} read something very interesting:
  \begin{quote}
    At (solar) noon on the longest day of summer, in the ancient city of Syene
    (modern day \link[Aswan]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan}) the
    Sun shines to the bottom of all open wells.
  \end{quote}
  He realized that this means
  that at noon, on the longest day, the Sun was directly overhead
  Aswan. Eratosthenes wondered if the Sun was also directly overhead
  \link[Alexandria]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria} on that
  same day. So, he put a stick perpendicularly into the ground, and
  saw that Sun was not directly overhead Alexandria at this time by
  observing the shadow of the stick. Eratosthenes was able to use this
  information, and a little more, to compute the circumference of the
  Earth. Wow!



  Now, you will play the role of Eratosthenes!

Here is a schematic diagram of the situation:

        \tkzMarkAngle[size=.3,mark={}](H,K,A)
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Explain why:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The Sun's rays are essentially parallel.
    \item The angle opposite $\alpha$ has the same measure as $\beta$.
    \item The the measure of angle $\alpha$ is the same as the measure
      of angle $\beta$. If you use a famous theorem, you need to
      explain why that is true too.

\begin{question}
Eratosthenes had someone ``pace'' the distance from Alexandria
    to Aswan, and found it to be around $500$ miles. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Use this new information, along with the previous problems, to
   estimate the circumference of the Earth.
 \item Now let's think critically about some fun facts!
   \begin{description}
   \item[Fun fact 1:] The actual circumference of the Earth at the
     equator is $24,901$ miles.
   \item[Fun fact 2:] The actual latitude of Alexandria is 31.2
     degrees North and the actual latitude of Aswan is 24.1 degrees
     North. The distance between them is 524 miles. If we use
     Eratosthenes' method with these \textbf{correct} numbers, we find
     the circumference of the Earth to be $26,569$ miles.
   \end{description}
   How is it possible that this computation is wrong (it's too large)?
   \begin{hint}
     Look at a map.

%        that the Sun seems to follow you as you travel.

%          \end{tikzpicture}
%        \end{center}
%        Since the Sun's rays are parallel, we see
%            $\beta=\gamma$. Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are vertical
%        angles, we see from ``What's Your Angle'' that $\gamma =
%        \alpha$, and hence $\alpha = \beta$.
%      \item I measured the angle with GeoGebra
%        \begin{center}
%          \includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{shadowFax.png}
%        \end{center}
%        From this we see the angle is around $7$ degrees.
%      \item The distance from Alexandria to Aswan is around $500$
%        miles, so
%        \[
%        \frac{360}{7}\cdot 500 \approx 25714~\text{miles}
%        \]
%        so the the Earth has about a $25000$ mile circumference. This is quite close to the current answer of $24901$ miles.
%      \item You don't need a clock, Eratosthenes surely just looked to
%        see when the shadow was SHORTEST. Since the Sun is highest at
%        noon, the shadow would be shortest at this time.

%%\begin{question}%%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_girdling_Earth 
%%  Here a problem that is at least $300$ years old, so let's call it an
%%  ``oldie, but a goodie!''
%%  \begin{quote}
%%    Imagine a chain, pulled tight around the Earth's equator. Suppose
%%    you add an extra $10'$ to the chain. The chain is then raised up
%%    UNIFORMLY, all around the Earth, as high as possible. How high is
%%    that?
%%  \end{quote}
%%  Supposing that
%%  \begin{itemize}
%%  \item There are $5280$ feet in a mile, and
%%  \item the radius of the Earth is $4000$ miles,
%%  \end{itemize}
%%  it is now time for YOU to try YOUR hand at this classic.
%%  \begin{enumerate}
%%  \item Give a solution based on FORMULAS. Show all work and express
%%    your answer in FEET.
%%  \item Give a solution based on SCALING. Show all work and express
%%    your answer in FEET.
%%  \item Is the answer surprising? YES or NO. EXPLAIN why you say YES or
%%    NO.
%%  \end{enumerate}
%%  \begin{freeResponse}
%%    \begin{enumerate}
%%    \item Let $h$ be the maximum height above the Earth to which we
%%      can uniformly raise the chain. Using formulas I find:
%%      \[
%%      2\pi(4000 + h) = 2\pi 4000 + 10/5280
%%      \]
%%      Solving for $h$ and converting to feet will solve the
%%      problem. Write:
%%      \begin{align*}
%%        2\pi(4000 + h) &= 8000\pi + 10/5280 \\
%%        8000\pi + 2\pi h &= 8000\pi + 10/5280\\
%%        2\pi h &= 10/5280\\
%%        h &= \frac{10}{2\pi \cdot 5280}~\text{miles}.
%%      \end{align*}
%%      This is
%%      \[
%%      \frac{10}{2\pi}\approx 1.6~\text{feet}.
%%      \]
%%    \item We are scaling the circumference by a factor of
%%      \[
%%      \frac{2\pi 4000 + 10/5280}{2\pi 4000}.
%%      \]
%%      Thus we are scaling the radius by THE SAME FACTOR. The scaled
%%      radius will be
%%      \begin{align*}
%%        \frac{2\pi 4000 + 10/5280}{2\pi 4000}\cdot 4000 &= \frac{2\pi 4000 + 10/5280}{2\pi}\\
%%        &=  4000 +  \frac{10}{2\pi5280}.
%%      \end{align*}
%%      So an increase of $\frac{10}{2\pi5280}$ miles. This is
%%      \[
%%      \frac{10}{2\pi}\approx 1.6~\text{feet}.
%%      \]
%%      
%%    \item Well, we are scaling the diameter by a small amount when
%%      compared to the Earth's circumference. Since
%%      \[
%%      \text{Earth's radius} < \text{Earth's circumference}
%%      \]
%%      we should expect less of a ``result'' from scaling the
%%      radius---so an answer between $0$ and $10$. So NO, I am not
%%      surprised.
