\begin{question}\index{symmetry}
What is \textit{symmetry}?
\end{question}

You should think about the question above \textbf{before} reading
on---though, uncharistically, we will give an answer eventually.
Let's start by giving some examples of symmetry. An object can have
symmetry \textit{through reflections}:
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{creepFace.pdf}
\end{image}
Check it out---if the nose is along line line $x=0$, then the
reflection $\mat{F}_{x=0}$ does not change the picture.

An object can have symmetry \textit{through rotations}:
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{rotFlags.pdf}
\end{image}
Check it out---if this object is centered at the origin, then the
rotation $\mat{R}_{120}$ does not change the picture.


An object can have symmetry \textit{through translations} if it
extends infinitely in some direction.  Imagine the pattern
below extending infinitely both to the left and the right:
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{fpGraphEx1.pdf}
\end{image}
Now the translation $\mat{T}_{(4,0)}$ does not change the
picture---note, we assumed that each square above is 1 unit.

\begin{question}
What other translations don't change the picture?
\end{question}



An object can have symmetry \textit{through dilations}.  Here we need
to imagine the entire plane filled with tiles as below:
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{sierpinskiCarpet.pdf}
\end{image}
This picture (assuming it extended infinitely) would have symmetry
through $\mat{D}_s$ for some scale factor $s$, see Activity~\ref{A:dilation}.


Trying to combine all these different ideas of symmetry is not easy.
In \cite{rosen}, it is said
\begin{center}\index{symmetry}
\textbf{Symmetry is immunity to a possible change.}
\end{center}

\begin{question}
Can you explain what the definition of symmetry above is saying?
\end{question}
