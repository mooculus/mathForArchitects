%% Why triangles


\begin{exercise} True or False:  %% 1,1,10 is a counter example
  Three proposed lengths for sides will always uniquely determine a
  triangle.
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Consider a generic triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, and angles
  $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\alpha$ opposite $a$,
  \item $\beta$ opposite $b$, and
  \item $\gamma$ opposite $c$.
  \end{itemize}
  Suppose $b=4$, $c=5$, and $\alpha = 30^\circ$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item This is congruent to exactly one triangle.
  \item There are noncongruent triangles with this property.
  \item There are no triangles with this property.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
