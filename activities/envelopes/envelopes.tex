In this activity, we'll investigate how we actually make curves via
envelopes of tangents.


\begin{problem}
Consider the following curve:
\[
\includegraphics{envU.pdf}
\]
Use 7-line envelope of tangents to draw this curve in the provided
grid:
\[
\includegraphics{complexPlane.pdf}
\]
\end{problem}


\break


\begin{problem}
Consider the following curve:
\[
\includegraphics{envS.pdf}
\]
Use 7-line envelope of tangents to draw this curve in the provided
grid:
\[
\includegraphics{complexPlane.pdf}
\]
\end{problem}

\break

\begin{problem}
Consider the following curve:
\[
\includegraphics{envO.pdf}
\]
Use 7-line envelope of tangents to draw this curve in the provided
grid:
\[
\includegraphics{complexPlane.pdf}
\]
Check your solution with a compass---what do you find?
\end{problem}
