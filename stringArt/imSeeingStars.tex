\index{stars}

Can you remember when you first learned to draw a star? I can! I was first taught to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{bartTri.pdf}
\]
But I wanted to know how to draw 5-pointed stars like the other
kids. So one day I taught myself to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{bartTri2.pdf}
\]
This may seem like a silly way to draw this star---it certainly makes
me chuckle now. Let's see if we can give a theory for drawing stars
that will connect the two different stars above, teach you how to
draw some new stars, and learn a little more mathematics along the
way.

We'll start with $5$ points equally spaced on a circle:
\[
\includegraphics{stfive.pdf}
\]
Think of these points as \textit{pins}.  Next we'll start at the top
and draw lines that we'll think of as \textit{strings}, moving
clockwise to the point two steps away each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stfive1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive3.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive5.pdf}
\]
Check it out, we got a star! If we had used pins and string to make
this star, we could have done it with one piece of string.

Now start with $6$ points equally spaced on a circle. Again, we'll
move clockwise two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stsix1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix3.pdf}
\]
Oops, we've run out of points! No worries, just start again at one of
the points that hasn't been touched by a line yet, drawing lines and
moving two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stsix4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix5.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix6.pdf}
\]
Ah! The other star! In this case, if we used pins and strings, we'd
need to use \textit{two} pieces of string. Hmmm---at this point I have
a question:
\begin{question} 
How do we actually draw $n$ equally spaced points on a circle?
\end{question}
 
You can figure that one out---or just ask someone who is standing up at
the front of some room talking to themselves. Oh! And I have another
question:
\begin{question} 
What happens if you put $n$ points, and connect them by moving $s$
steps each time?
\end{question}
I'm feeling generous, so I'll help out with this one. Let's do a bunch
of examples together. I'm hoping that the following notation will help
out:\index{ns@$\star{n}{s}$}
\[
\star{n}{s}=\text{the star with $n$ equally spaced points where we move $s$ steps clockwise}
\]
\begin{warning}
Remember, $\star{n}{s}$ is a star, \textbf{not} a fraction!
\end{warning}
Armed with our new notation, let's draw the following stars!
\[
{
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline
 \includegraphics{stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{stseven.pdf} \\
\star{7}{1} & \star{7}{2} & \star{7}{3} \\\hline 
 \includegraphics{stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{stseven.pdf} & \includegraphics{stseven.pdf} \\
\star{7}{4} & \star{7}{5} & \star{7}{6} \\\hline 
\end{array}
}
\]

\begin{question}
Do you notice any patterns? Why not share your observations with a
friend---or an enemy?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Looking back, we see that some stars, like $\star{7}{2}$, are one piece (or would use one piece of string). Other stars, like $\star{6}{2}$, are more than one piece. What's the general rule?
\end{question}
