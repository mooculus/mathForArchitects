Of all the isometries, \textit{translations} are probably the
easiest. With a translation, all we do is move our object in a
straight line, that is, every point in the plane is moved the same
distance and the same direction. Let's see what happens to Louie
Llama\index{Louie Llama} when he is translated:

Pretty simple eh? We can give a more ``mathematical'' definition of a
translation involving our newly-found knowledge of matrices! Check it:

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{translation}, denoted by $\mat{T}_{(u,v)}$, is a function
that moves every point a given distance $u$ in the $x$-direction and a
given distance $v$ in the $y$-direction. We will use the following
matrix to represent translations:
\[
\mat{T}_{(u,v)} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & u \\ 
0 & 1 & v \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\end{definition}


\begin{example} 
Consider the point $\vec{p} = (-3,2)$. Use a matrix to translate
$\vec{p}$ $5$ units right and $4$ units down.
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{transEg1.pdf}
\end{image}
\begin{explanation}
Here is how you do it:
\begin{align*}
\mat{T}_{(5,-4)} \vec{p} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 5 \\ 
0 & 1 & -4 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-3 \\
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}\\
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
\answer[given]{-3} + 0 + 5\\
0 + \answer[given]{2} - 4 \\
0 + 0 + 1
\end{bmatrix}\\
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
\answer[given]{2}\\
\answer[given]{-2} \\
\answer[given]{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
Hence, we end up with the point
$(\answer[given]{2},\answer[given]{-2})$. But you knew that already,
didn't you?
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{question} 
  Can you demonstrate with algebra why translations are isometries?


  \begin{prompt}
    To start we need two points, say $\vec{a} = (a,b)$ and $\vec{p} =
    (p,q)$. Now compute the distance between these two points using
    the distance formula:
    \[
    d(\vec{a},\vec{p}) = \answer{\sqrt{(a-p)^2 + (b-q)^2}}
    \]
    Now we will translate these two points using $\mat{T}_{(u,v)}$ and
    show that the distance between the translated points is the same
    distance found above. Write with me:
    \[
    \mat{T}_{(u,v)} \vec{a} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \answer{a + u}\\
      \answer{b + v}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    and
    \[
    \mat{T}_{(u,v)} \vec{p} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \answer{p + u}\\
      \answer{q + v}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    Now, compute the distance between $\mat{T}_{(u,v)} \vec{a}$ and
    $\mat{T}_{(u,v)} \vec{p}$:
    \[
    d(\mat{T}_{(u,v)} \vec{a}, \mat{T}_{(u,v)} \vec{p}) =
    \answer{\sqrt{(a-p)^2 + (b-q)^2}}.
    \]
    Since the distances found \wordChoice{\choice{are
        different}\choice[correct]{are the same}}, we see that
    translations are isometries.
  \end{prompt}
\end{question}



\begin{question} 
We know how to translate individual points. How do we move entire
figures and other funky shapes?
\begin{prompt}
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice[correct]{I've thought about this.}
  \choice{I've not thought about this.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{idea}
  Well, one way to do it is to apply a translation to every single
  point in the picture. This is hard for a human to do, and usually
  requires a computer.

  On the other hand, if you can somehow group all the pieces together,
  you just move one point, and then place all the other points
  relative to the first.
\end{idea}
