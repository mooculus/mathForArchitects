\begin{definition}
 The \emph{scale factor} of a model/object is how much each linear dimension (ie, length, width, height) is scaled. This is often written as a ratio, where $1:x$ would mean that every length is scaled (ie, multiplied) by $x$. \end{definition}

\begin{question}
  Let's think about scaling squares and cubes. Let's start with a
  square with dimensions $s\times s$ and cube with dimensions $s\times
  s\times s$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Scale a square by a scale factor of $3$. What's the \emph{area} of the new square? 
  \item Scale a cube by a scale factor of $3$. What's the \emph{volume} of the new cube?
  \item Scale a cube by a scale factor of $3$. What's the \emph{area of one face} of the new cube?
  \item Scale a cube by a scale factor of $3$. What's the \emph{surface area} of the new cube?
  \end{enumerate}
  In each case above, \emph{draw pictures} to help you explain why
  your answer is correct.

\begin{question}
  We know how squares and cubes scale, but what about weird shapes?
  Louie Llama can help us out here.  Consider this picture:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{llamaScaled.pdf}
  \end{center}
  Let\index{Louie Llama}
  \begin{align*}
    L &= \text{Area of Louie Llama}\\
    S &= \text{Area of Square}\\
    B &= \text{Area of bigger llama, Blouie Llama}.
  \end{align*}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $x$ is the scale-factor, explain why:
    \[
    \frac{L}{S} = \frac{B}{x^2 S}
    \]
  \item Solve for $B$ above, and explain how this demonstrates how
    scaling linear dimensions changes the area of \emph{any} 2D object.
  \end{enumerate}
