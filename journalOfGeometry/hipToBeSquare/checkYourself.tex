\begin{exercise}
  Here is a bag of \textit{Play Time Happy Fun Balls}:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{ballsInBag.jpg}
  \end{center}
  About how many play balls are in the bag?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item around $50$
  \item around $100$
  \item around $200$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Suppose that every ball has a mass of $5$ grams.  What expression
  will best approximate the mass of the bag?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $(\text{total number of balls})\times5$
  \item $(\text{total number of balls})\times25$
  \item $(\text{total number of balls})\times125$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Suppose they make a bag of \textit{Play Time Happy Fun Balls} where
  every linear dimension of the bag is scaled by a factor $2$.

  
  \textbf{How many more play balls are in this larger bag?}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Half as many.
  \item Twice as many.
  \item Four times as many.
  \item Six times as many.
  \item Eight times as many.
  \item Sixteen times as many.
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{multicols}

\begin{exercise}
 Suppose they make a bag of \textit{Play Time Happy Fun Balls} where
  every linear dimension of the bag is scaled by a factor $2$.

  
  \textbf{How much longer will the zipper be (at the top of the bag)
    to access the balls?}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Half as long.
  \item Twice as long.
  \item Four times as long.
  \item Six times as long.
  \item Eight times as long.
  \item Sixteen times as long.
