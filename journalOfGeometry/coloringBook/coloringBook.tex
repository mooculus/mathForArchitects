Consider this picture:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{egR4D8.png}
\end{center}

This is a colored-in page. Setting $e$ be the do-nothing symmetry, $r$
be a clockwise $45^\circ$ rotation about the center of the hexagon,
and $f$ be a flip across a vertical line down the middle of the
picture.

BEFORE it was colored, it had $8$ rotational symmetries
\[
e,r,r^2,r^3,\dots, r^7
\]
and $8$ reflectional symmetries
\[
f,rf,r^2f, r^3f,\dots,r^7f.
\]
AFTER it was colored, it had $4$ rotational symmetries that when
EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF THE PREVIOUS SYMMETRIES we have
\[
e,r^2,r^4,r^6
\]
and NO reflectional symmetries.

\begin{question}
  This question is about symmetries of the equilateral triangle.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $f$, $g$, and $h$, be the symmetries of the equilateral
    triangle that are ``flips.''
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ flips across a vertical line through the center of the triangle.
    \item $g$ flips across a line of positive slope.
    \item $h$ flips across a line of negative slope.
    \end{itemize}
    Express every symmetry of the equilateral triangle in terms of:
    \[
    e,f,g,h,fg,fh
    \]
  \item Make a MULTIPLICATION table for these elements. As a gesture
    of friendship, I have started this for you:
           \[
  \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    & e & f & g & h & fg & fh\\ \hline\hline
    e &  &   &     &   &    &     \\ \hline
    f &   &     &   &    &      &  \\ \hline
    g &     &   &   &      &   &  \\ \hline
    h  &   &      &    &   &     &  \\ \hline
    fg &    &   &      &   &   &    \\ \hline
    fh &      &    &   &     &   &  \\ \hline
  \end{array}
  \]
  \item Let $r$ represent a $120$ degree clockwise rotation and $f$
    represent a flip across a vertical line through the center of the
    picture. CAN you draw a picture whose symmetries are
    \[
    e,r,r^2,f,rf,r^2f
    \]
    BUT when you color it some special way, it only has symmetries:
    \[
    e,f,rf,r^2f?
    \]
    WHY OR WHY NOT? EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Here are the elements:
      \[
      e = e, r = fg, r^2 = fh, f= f, rf = h, r^2f=g.
      \]
    \item  Here's the table:
      \[
      \begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        & e  & f   & g  & h  & fg & fh  \\ \hline\hline
        e  & e  & f   & g  & h  & fg & fh  \\ \hline
        f  & f  & e   & fg & fh & g  & h   \\ \hline
        g  & g  & fh  & e  & fg & h  & f   \\ \hline
        h  & h  & fg  & fh & e  & f  & g   \\ \hline
        fg & fg & h   & f  & g  & fh & e   \\ \hline
        fh & fh & g   & h  & f  & e  & fg  \\ \hline
      \end{array}
      \]
    \item NO this is not possible. As soon as the object has
      symmetries through $f$, $g$, and $h$, it will have symmetries
      through $f^2$, $fg$ and $fh$, and these are the symmetries
      $e,r,r^2$.
