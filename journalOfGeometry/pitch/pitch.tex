The steepness of a roof is called its \textit{slope} or
\textit{pitch}. This is a fraction where the numerator is the
\textit{rise} of the roof and the denominator is the \textit{run}. The
denominator is usually $12$. Moreover, when one talks of ``pitch''
they usually omit the denominator of $12$. Hence
\begin{center}
\fbox{a slope of $\frac{7}{12}$}\quad is the same as\quad \fbox{a pitch of $7$}.
\end{center}
This slope (or pitch) says that the roof goes up $7''$ for every
$12''$. Note there are several other notations for pitch. The one we
are presenting here is not only rather common, it is also
mathematically correct!

\begin{question}
  Here is a roof that is pointed in the middle:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{symRoof.jpg}
  \end{center}
Below is a diagram of the roof as seen from the top:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[x=2cm,y=2cm]
    \draw[ultra thick] (0,0) rectangle (3,2.4);
    %\draw[dashed] (.5,.5) rectangle (4.3,2.5);
    \draw[ultra thick] (0,1.2) -- (3,1.2);
    \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm},decorate,thin] (0,0)--(0,2.4);
    \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm,mirror},decorate,thin] (0,0)--(3,0);
    \node at (-.4,1.2) {$24'$};
    \node at (1.5,-.44) {$30'$};
    \node at (1.5,2.1) {slope of $9/12$};
    \node[above] at (1.5,1.2) {main ridge};
    \node at (1.5,.3) {slope of $9/12$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Find the area of the roof.  Explain the work in your solution.

\begin{freeResponse}
  If we look at the roof from the side, it looks like:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[x=2cm,y=2cm]
    \draw[ultra thick] (0,0) -- (1.2,0)  -- (1.2, .9) -- (0,0) ;
    \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm,mirror},decorate,thin] (0,0)--(1.2,0);
    \draw[decoration={brace,raise=.2cm,mirror},decorate,thin] (1.2,0)--(1.2,.9);
    \node at (.6,-.25) {$12'$};
    \node[anchor=west] at (1.3,.45) {$12'\cdot 9/12$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    
  \end{center}
    By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is
    \[
    \sqrt{12^2+ 9^2} = 15~\text{feet}.
    \]
    Thus, the area of the roof is
    \[
    2\cdot 15\cdot 30 = 900~\text{square feet}.
    \]

\begin{question}
In Europe, it is more common to measure the steepness of a roof using
the angle of the roof from horizontal. This is nice if you want to
``think'' in angles \textbf{(easy to visualize)}, but to give directions
in terms of slope \textbf{(easier to measure)}. In this case,
\textbf{tangent} comes to the rescue:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\frac{opposite}{\cancel{hypotenuse}}}{\frac{adjacent}{\cancel{hypotenuse}}}=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}.
\]



\begin{enumerate}
\item If we have a line in the $(x,y)$-plane that makes an angle of
  $\theta$ with the $x$-axis,
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{axis}[
          xmin=-2.2,
          xmax=2.2,
          ymin=-2.2,
          ymax=2.2,
          axis lines=center,
          xlabel=$x$,
          ticks=none,
          ylabel=$y$,
          every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},disabledatascaling
        ]
        \addplot [ultra thick, black, smooth] {x+1};
        \draw (-.4,0) arc (0:28:1);
        \node at (-.6,.2) {$\theta$};
        \node[right] at (.5,1.3) {$y=m\cdot x+b$};
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  Then $\tan(\theta) = m$. Explain using words, pictures, and so on,
  WHY this is true.
\item Find a whole number numerator $n$ such that a slope of
  $\frac{n}{12}$ best corresponds to a $30^\circ$ angle. Show your
  work.
\item Find a pitch $p$ (a whole number) such that a pitch of $p$ best
  corresponds to a $40^\circ$ angle. Show your work.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
 Your friend \textit{Geometry Giorgio} is working with you converting
 angles to slope.  \textit{Geometry Giorgio} says:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item I used my calculator to find $\tan(44.77) \approx 1$, so I conclude a slope of $12/12$.
        \item I used my calculator to find $\tan(60.01) \approx 1/3$, so I conclude a slope of $4/12$.
        \item I used my calculator to find $\tan(10.01) \approx 2/3$, so I conclude a slope of $8/12$.
        \end{enumerate}
  Is \textit{Geometry Giorgio} correct? If not, \textbf{explain what (calculator!) mistake
    he is making} and explain how \textit{Geometry Giorgio} could have
  \textbf{figured this out by thinking about his numbers and the meaning of tangent.}
\begin{freeResponse}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If the slope of the line is
    \[
    m = \frac{rise}{run}
    \]
    then we can draw:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            xmin=-2.2,
            xmax=2.2,
            ymin=-2.2,
            ymax=2.2,
            axis lines=center,
            xlabel=$x$,
            ticks=none,
            ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},disabledatascaling
          ]
          \addplot [ultra thick, black, smooth] {x+1};
          \draw[line width=3,->] (.3,0)--(.3,1.3);          
          \draw[line width=3,->] (-1,0)--(.3,0);
          \draw (-.4,0) arc (0:28:1);
          \node at (-.6,.2) {$\theta$};
          \node[right] at (.3,.65) {$rise$};
          \node[below] at (-.35,0) {$run$};
        \end{axis}
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Thus
    \[
    \tan(\theta) =\frac{opposite}{adjacent} = \frac{rise}{run} = m.
    \]
  \item So $12\cdot \tan(30^\circ) \approx 6.93$. This means a slope
    of $7/12$ would work best.

  \item So $12\cdot \tan(40^\circ)\approx 10$. This means a pitch of
    $10$ would be best.
  \item Geometry Giorgio is working in radians, not degrees.
    He got lucky with $44.77$ degrees.

    Also, he should know that $60$ degrees CANNOT correspond to a
    slope of $4/12$! And  that $10$ degrees CANNOT correspond to a
    slope of $8/12$!
