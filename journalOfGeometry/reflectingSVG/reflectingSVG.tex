\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Describe the difference between raster and vector graphics.
\item Understand when one would want to use raster over vector
  graphics and vice versa
\item Demonstrate the ability to create an SVG image.
\item Demonstrate the ability to apply a geometric transformation to
  an SVG image.
\end{listOutcomes}



\begin{question}
  Use the INTERNET to look up the DIFFERENCE between \textbf{RASTER}
  (or BITMAP) graphics AND \textbf{VECTOR} graphics.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item EXPLAIN the DIFFERENCE between \textbf{RASTER} graphics AND
    \textbf{VECTOR} graphics. Use words, pictures, examples, and so on
    as needed/helpful.
  \item Does \snap\ produce raster or vector graphics?
  \item What is SVG format?
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Raster graphics are images that are determined by individual
      points; a line is represented by points in a row.

      Raster graphics might look great at one size, but will look
      terrible if scaled, as the points (the pixels) will be scaled
      too.
      
      On the other hand, vector graphics are abstractly defined; a line
      is determined by its end points, and the drawing program makes
      the line for us at an appropriate scale-factor.
    \item \snap\ produces raster graphics.
    \item SVG format is Scalable Vector Graphics, and is a vector
      graphics format.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{freeResponse}

\begin{question}
  Raster graphics and vector graphics serve different purposes.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item DESCRIBE and EXPLAIN some SITUATIONS where raster graphics are best.
  \item DESCRIBE and EXPLAIN some SITUATIONS where vector graphics are best.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If your creating an image for a screen with low resolution,
      or developing for a screen that has exactly one scale factor,
      then RASTER graphics usually look best.
    \item If you want an image that can be scaled to any size and
      always seem smooth, then vector graphics are best.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
  Identify a program that will allow you to create files in SVG
  format.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item STATE which program you are using.
  \item Use your program to draw an SVG image that does not have
    reflection symmetry across horizontal lines. DISPLAY YOUR IMAGE
    BELOW.
  \item Use your program to flip your image across a horizontal
    line. DISPLAY YOUR IMAGE BELOW.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
  \item I use Inkscape.
  \item Meet Louie Llama:

  \item Which side of his is best?
