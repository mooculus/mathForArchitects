\begin{question} 
  Explain how the following picture ``proves'' that the area of a RIGHT
  triangle is one half of the base times the height.
  \begin{center}

  \end{center}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    We know that the area of a rectangle of height $h$ and width $b$
    has area $h\cdot b$. However, we can also see that every right
    triangle can be placed in such a rectangle, while occupying
    exactly half the area. Hence the area of a RIGHT triangle is:
    \[
    \text{Area of right triangle} = \frac{bh}{2}
    \]

\begin{question}
  ``Shearing'' is a process where you take a shape, cut it into thin strips, 
  then push the strips around in one direction to make a new shape.  
  Cavalieri's principle states:\index{Cavalieri's principle}
  \begin{quote}
    Shearing parallel to a fixed direction does not change the
    $n$-dimensional measure of an object.
  \end{quote}
  EXPLAIN how the first problem, combined with the following
  picture ``proves'' (via Cavalieri's principle) that the area of ANY
  triangle is one half of the base times the height.
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics{pbpShearTri.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    If we want to know the area of any triangle, simply shear it to be a right triangle:
    \[
    \text{MISSING PICTURE}
    \]
    Since shearing doesn't change the area, by Cavalieri's principle,
    we see this right triangle has the same area as our original
    triangle. Thus the area of the original triangle is:
    \[
    \text{Area of any triangle} = \frac{bh}{2}
    \]
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question} Finally:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Give an intuitive argument explaining why Cavalieri's
    principle is true.
  \item Explain how to use a picture to ``prove'' that a triangle of a
    given (fixed) area could have an ARBITRARILY LARGE perimeter.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Imagine our triangle as being a cross section of stacked
      papers. Moving these papers around doesn't change the area of
      each of the slices, hence, shearing doesn't change the area.
    \item Consider this picture:
      \[
      \text{MISSING PICTURE}
      \]
      From this we can make a triangle with an arbitrarily large
      perimeter with a fixed area.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}
