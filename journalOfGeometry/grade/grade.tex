\begin{question}
  Roofs aren't the only things measured with pitch. Ramps are also measure using pitch. 
  
  The ADA says that ramps should have a slope $1:12$, meaning rise $1 \ foot$ for every $12\ feet$ in horizontal length. Also, ramps should be no more that $30\ feet$ long without a landing. 
  
  
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What is the vertical height for a $30\ foot$ long ramp? Explain your reasoning. 
 \item What is the angle between the ramp and the ground?
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}

\begin{question}
The entrance to the Math Tower from 18th Avenue is $7\ stairs$ tall. Each stair is $13\ inches$ long and $5.5\ inches$ tall, with a $52\ inch$ landing. If OSU wanted to add a ramp at this entrance, how long would it need to be?

  \end{question}

\begin{question}
Roads are typically measured with \textbf{grade}. Grade is simply
turning the slope into a percentage; that is, a slope with a
denominator of $100$.  Here are two road grade warning signs. Each
give a grade and a mileage.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{gradeWarning}
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{truckGradeWarning}
\end{center}
In each case, find the change in elevation over the warning area. As a reminder, $1\ mile=5280\ ft.$
\end{question}
