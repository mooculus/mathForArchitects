Again, literally repeating ourselves for probably a third time: It is
difficult to grasp the size of large numbers without a context that
seems real to us. We'll use the context of ``cold, hard, cash'' and
the ``cruel curse of time'' to help us understand the magnitude of
numbers. Moreover, we have TWO daydreams to help us:

\begin{mdframed}[style=OutcomeStyle]
  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Dollar-a-second Daydream:}\\
  Suppose you were paid the secondly wage of $\$1$, meaning you are
  paid a dollar \text{every second} of every minute, of every hour, of
  every day, and so on.
\end{quote}
\end{mdframed}



\begin{mdframed}[style=OutcomeStyle]
  \begin{quote}
  \textbf{Pennies-a-day Daydream:}\\
  Suppose you were paid the following way: Just a penny on your first
  day, double that (two pennies) the next, double that (four pennies)
  the next, and so on, each day doubling the payment amount.
\end{quote}
\end{mdframed}
