\begin{question}
  You are planning a building with a square parking lot.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item You realize that if you re-arrange your design, you can make
    the square parking lot $13\%$ bigger on each side. How many more
    cars can park in this new lot? Answer in terms of a percent and
    Explain your reasoning.
  \item Upon further inspection, you realize that with just a little
    more re-arrangement, you can turn your original square parking lot
    into a rectangle that is $9\%$ larger on one side, and $22\%$
    larger on the other. How many more cars can park in this new lot?
    Answer in terms of a percent and Explain your reasoning.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Well, if the side length is $13\%$ bigger, then the area is
      \[
      1.13\cdot 1.13 = \text{$28$ percent larger}
      \]
      so, we could park $28\%$ more cars.
    \item So if we make a rectangle parking lot that is $9\%$ larger on
      one side, and $22\%$ larger on the other, then the area is
      \[
      1.09\cdot 1.22 = \text{$33$ percent larger}
      \]
      so, we could park $33\%$ more cars.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
  You decide to buy an inflatable pool that is $10$ feet wide and $3$
  feet deep:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{tenFtPool.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose you have a coupon for $10\%$ off the price of the
      pool above. At the checkout counter, the cashier asks you, ``Do
      you want me to compute the discount before or after the tax?''
      \textbf{To save the most money, should you compute the discount
        before or after tax?} Explain your reasoning.
    \item Now that you have the pool, you plan to have a pool party at
      $4$pm the next day. Given that you can fill a bowl that is $5$
      inches wide and $1.5$ inches deep with water in just $1/4$th of
      a second, \textbf{when should you start filling your pool to
        ensure it is ready by $\boldsymbol 4$pm?}  Explain your
      reasoning.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Well, it doesn't matter, because multiplication is commutative.
      \[
      0.9 \cdot (\text{tax}) \cdot (\text{cost of pool})= (\text{tax})\cdot
      0.9\cdot (\text{cost of pool}).
      \]
    \item So, the pool has
      \[
      12^3 \cdot 2^3 = 13824
      \]
      times as much volume as the bowl of water. Hence it will take
      \[
      13824/4 = 3456 ~\text{seconds}
      \]
      or
      \[
      \frac{3456}{60\cdot 60} \approx 1~\text{hour}.
      \]
      We should start filling the pool at $3$pm to be ready by $4$pm.

\begin{question} 
  You've designed a roughly spherical water tank:
\begin{center}%http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Spring16/154/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RMendez_Photo_1950s.pdf
  \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{tank.png}  
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How does the cost of the raw materials will change if the radius
  is reduced by $10\%$?
\item How does the capacity change if the radius is reduced by $10\%$?
\item How does the filled-weight change if the radius is increased by
  $10\%$?
\item How does the empty-weight change if the radius is increased by
  $10\%$.
\item How does the filled-weight change if the empty-weight is
  increased by $10\%$.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{In each case, answer in terms of a percent and EXPLAIN your reasoning.}
\begin{freeResponse}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Well, the amount of raw materials (and hence the cost) scales
    like the surface area. So if the radius is reduced by $10\%$, the
    cost of the raw materials is reduced by
    \[
    0.9\cdot 0.9 = 0.81
    \]
    and hence is reduced by $19\%$.
  \item The capacity scales like the volume.  So if the radius is
    reduced by $10\%$, the capacity is reduced by
    \[
    0.9\cdot 0.9\cdot 0.9 = 0.729
    \]
    and hence is reduced by $27\%$.
  \item The filled-weight scales like the volume, so if the radius is
    increased by $10\%$ we find
    \[
    1.10^3 \approx 1.33
    \]
    and this is a $33\%$ increase.
  \item The empty-weight scales like surface area, so if the radius is
    increased by $10\%$ we find
    \[
    1.10^2 \approx 1.21
    \]
    and this is a $21\%$ increase in the empty-weight
  \item Well, if the empty-weight is increased by $10\%$, then the
    radius is increased
    \[
    \sqrt{1.1} \approx 1.05
    \]
    and hence is increased by $5\%$. But filled-weight corresponds to
    a
    \[
    1.05^3 \approx 1.16
    \]
    scaling of the volume, and this is a $16\%$ increase in filled-weight.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{freeResponse}
