\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Apply formulas to compute the surface areas and volumes of
  solids.
\item Acknowledge that even with a formula, difficult work still needs
  to be done.
\item Identify answers that are incorrect by an order of magnitude or
  more.
\item Estimate surface area and volume up to an order of magnitude.
\end{listOutcomes}


Here are a bunch of formulas I found on the INTERNET at this site

Below, let's think about some questions.

\begin{question}
  Consider the \link[\textit{Ericsson Globe}]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_Globe}:
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{dome.png} %https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-a-hemispherical-dome-in-modern-civil-engineering-Stockholm-Globe-Arena-by_fig2_308655043
   \end{center}
   Assuming that this building has a diameter of $110$ meters and a
   height of $85$ meters.
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Use the formulas above to find the surface area (including
     the bottom!) and the volume of the \textit{Ericsson Globe}.
   \item Now, find the surface area and volume of a box that is
     $100''\times 100'' \times 80''$.
     \item Compare/contrast your answers from this part with your
       answers from the first part.
   \end{enumerate}
   \begin{freeResponse}
     \begin{enumerate}
     \item Using the formulas above I found:
       \[
       SA = 2\pi 55\cdot 85 \approx 29374 \text{ square meters}
       \]
       and
       \[
       V = \pi85^2 \left(55-\frac{85}{3}\right)\approx  605280 \text{ cubic meters}.
       \]
     \item For a box that is  $100''\times 100'' \times 80''$, I find
       \[
       SA = 2(100\cdot 100 + 100\cdot 80 + 100\cdot 80) = 52000 \text{ square inches}
       \]
       and
       \[
       V = 100\cdot 100\cdot 80 \approx 800000 \text{ cubic inches}.
       \]
     \end{enumerate}
     \item While our answers have different numbers, they have the same number of DIGITS.

\begin{question}
  Consider the \link[\textit{Luxor Las Vegas}]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_Las_Vegas}:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{pyramid.jpg} 
  \end{center}
 Assuming that the (square) base of this building has a side length of
 $646$ feet and that the pyramid is $350$ feet tall,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Which is EASIER to compute:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the surface area (including the bottom!) OR
    \item the volume
    \end{itemize}
    of the \textit{Luxor Las Vegas}? EXPLAIN WHY one computation is
    HARDER, and compute the EASIER one.
  \item You ask four friends what the surface area of the
    \textit{Luxor Las Vegas} is. They give you four wrong answers, but
    you love them anyway, because they are your friends. Here are
    their answers:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $1500$ square feet
    \item $15000$ square feet
    \item $150000$ square feet
    \item $1500000$ square feet
    \end{enumerate}
    Which answer above is \textbf{closest} to the correct answer? EXPLAIN your reasoning.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The volume is MUCH EASIER to compute than the surface
        area. To compute the surface area, you have to compute the
        area of each face of the pyramid, this requires GEOMETRY.

        The volume is
        \[
        V = \frac{646\cdot 646\cdot 350}{3} \approx = 48686867 \text{ cubic feet}.
        \]
      \item Answer $(iii)$ is correct, here's how I know. The pyramid
        has a base, and four more sides. The biggest the surface area could be is
        \[
        646\cdot 646+ 4\cdot 85\cdot 323 = 869516.
        \]
        But honestly it is even easier:
        \[
        (\text{3-digit number}) \cdot (\text{3-digit number}) + 4\cdot
        (\text{3-digit number}) = (\text{6-digit number}).
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{freeResponse}

  Let's reflect on our work above.  In mathematics, it is USEFUL to
  know when a given answer is INCORRECT. There is a notion of
