%% What's your angle



\begin{exercise}
  I'm thinking of a polygon with $7$ sides. What is the \textbf{sum of
    the interior angles?}
\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise} I'm thinking of a regular polygon with $11$ sides, what's the measure of \textbf{an interior angle?}  
  \end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} Consider the following star:

  \starpoly{11}{1}

  If Louie Llama starts midway between points 1 and 2, then walks to
  point 2, turns toward point 3, walks to point 3, and so on, until he
  returns to his starting position; \textbf{through which total angle did
  Louie Llama turn?}

  
  \end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}  Consider the following star:

  \starpoly{11}{3}

  If Louie Llama starts midway between points 1 and 2, then walks to
  point 2, turns toward point 3, walks to point 3, and so on, until he
  returns to his starting position; \textbf{through which total angle did
  Louie Llama turn?}
  
  
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}  Consider the following star:

  \starpoly{11}{4}

  If Louie Llama starts midway between points 1 and 2, then walks to
  point 2, turns toward point 3, walks to point 3, and so on, until he
  returns to his starting position; \textbf{through which total angle did
  Louie Llama turn?}
  
  
\end{exercise}
