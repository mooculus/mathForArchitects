%% Staircases
%% Whole number of stairs, staircase must fit in the space. 


\begin{exercise}
  True or False: It is always possible to build a staircase of length $w$ and height $h$ that is to code. 
\end{exercise}
\vfill

\begin{exercise}
   True or False: \textbf{All} of the steps of determining the dimensions of a staircase are:
   
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Divide the total staircase height by the desired riser height, which give the total number of stairs,
 \item Divide the total staircase length by the total number of stairs, which will give the tread width,
 \item Using the desired riser height to construct the staircase
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} True or False: 
 For a staircase of height $300\ cm$, we would like to have risers that as close as possible to $18\ cm$. We should then have $17\ stairs$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} True or False: 
 For a staircase of height $300\ cm$ with $17\ stairs$, the risers will be exactly $18\ cm$ height.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
 You would like to construct a staircase of height $5\ feet$ and length $10\ feet$ where the risers must be at most $7\frac{3}{4}^{\prime\prime}$ and the treads must be at least $10^{\prime\prime}$. 
 
 
\begin{itemize}
 \item When using the \snap\ code, you type in \texttt{w: \rule{2cm}{0.4pt} h:\rule{2cm}{0.4pt}}.
 \item The value for \texttt{x-reg} should be \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}. The value for \texttt{y-reg} should be \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}.
\end{itemize}

 
When using the \snap\ code, you then get this table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
8&1.25& 0.65\\\hline
9& 1.111111& 0.555555 \\\hline
10 & 1 & 0.5\\\hline
11 & 0.909090 & 0.454545\\\hline
12&0.833333&0.416666\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
 \item This table means that you can build a staircase with \rule{2cm}{0.4pt} stairs.
 \item For a staircase with $11\ stairs$, the risers would \rule{2cm}{0.4pt} and treads would be \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
