  We make estimates of every-day objects in every-day settings and we
  observe the effects of scaling when we change objects.

\begin{question}
Look around our classroom. How many ping pong balls would it take to
\begin{enumerate}
\item Line one edge of the classroom?
\item Cover the floor?
\item Fill the room?
\end{enumerate}
In each case, EXPLAIN how you arrive at your conclusion.

\begin{question}
Did you notice our fellow student \textit{Geometry Giorgio}? He
suggests that we think in the following way:
\begin{quote}
  Say a ping pong ball has a diameter of $p$ inches, and a
tennis ball has a diameter of $t$ inches, then the answers for
(1a), (1b), and (1c) should be around $t/p$ times the answers for
(2a), (2b), and (2c).
\end{quote}
Is \textit{Geometry Giorgio} correct?  If he is
correct, explain why. If he is not correct, explain why and give the
correct answer.
\end{question}
