\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Demonstrate given shapes are rep-n-tiles.
\item Understand a relationship between scaling, perimeter, and area.
\end{listOutcomes}



Figureing out \textbf{how} shapes are rep-tiles can be difficult if
you don't actually have phyical copies of the rep-tiles to play with.
I suggest you have someone help you write a \snap\ script using the block:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{BLOCKreptile.png}
\end{center}
I'll explain the arguments (blanks in the BLOCK) for completness sake.
Working right-to-left, the first TURTLE BLANK is for a costume, the
second TURTLE BLANK is for a horizontal reflection of the costume, the
blank labled $r:$ is the size of the rotation in degrees, and the
blank labeled $w:$ is the desired width of the rep-tile.
\begin{itemize}
\item The ARROW keys will move the rep-tile around.
\item Pressing $r$ will rotate the rep-tile clockwise the specified
  number of degrees.
\item Pressing $f$ will flip the turtle horizontally across a line
  perpendicular to its base.
\end{itemize}

\begin{question}
Consider the following polygons:
\[
\includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{rhomb.png} \qquad
\includegraphics[width=.15\textwidth]{P.png}\qquad
\includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{wedge.png} 
\]
Use the REPTILE BLOCK to show that each of these polygons is a
rep-$4$-tile. A SCREENSHOT of the \snap\ STAGE is sufficent.
\end{question}

\mynewpage


\begin{question}
  Now we'll investigate a rep-$4$-tile and a rep-$5$-tile.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that the following polygon is a rep-$4$-tile:
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{sphinx.png}
    \end{center}
  \item Show that a $(1,2,\sqrt{5})$ right triangle is a
    rep-$5$-tile.
    \begin{hint}
      I suggest you rotate $90^\circ$.
    \end{hint}
  \end{enumerate}
  In each case, if you want to convince me that you have a rep-tile,
  you must EXPLAIN why the angles are unchanged, and why the
  proportions of the linear measurements are unchanged.
\end{question}

\mynewpage

\begin{question}
  Now we'll connect rep-tiles to SCALING area.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item EXPLAIN why given ANY rep-2-tile,
      \[
      \frac{\text{new perimeter}}{\text{old perimeter}}\qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{\text{new area}}{\text{old area}}
      \]
      will be constants that are invariant, regardless of the shape of
      the given rep-2-tile.
    \item EXPLAIN why given ANY rep-$n$-tile,
      \[
      \frac{\text{new perimeter}}{\text{old perimeter}}\qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{\text{new area}}{\text{old area}}
      \]
      will be constants that are invariant, regardless of the shape of
      the given rep-$n$-tile.
    \item
      Start make a table like the one below:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
          rep-$n$-tile & $\frac{\text{new perimeter}}{\text{old perimeter}}$ & $\frac{\text{new area}}{\text{old area}}$  \\
          \hline\hline
          2 & $\vdots$  &  $\vdots$  \\ 
          3 & $\vdots$  &  $\vdots$  \\ 
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      COMPLETE the table up to $n= 10$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
