Get out a piece of paper, a ruler, and a writing utensil. Really, do
it!  Seriously! Now draw two lines that come to a point:
\[
\includegraphics{mesh0.pdf}
\]
Next, take both of those lines and mark the midpoints. Connect the
midpoints with a line:
\[
\includegraphics{mesh1.pdf}
\]
Each original line is now divided into two segments. Mark the
midpoints of those segments and cross-connect them:
\[
\includegraphics{mesh2.pdf}
\]
If you continue this cross-connecting process, you'll get groovy pictures like these:
\[
\includegraphics{mesh3.pdf}
\]
Over 2000 years ago, Apollonius of Perga explained why the curve
formed by these segments is a \index{parabola}parabola. Today we call
what we just drew an \textit{envelope of tangents}\index{envelope of
  tangents}.  If we cross-connect $n$ pairs of lines we'll call this
an \textit{$n$-line envelope of tangents}.




\paragraph{B\'ezier curves}

While some of us like pointy drawings, others like smooth drawings. To
make smooth drawings, we'll need the help of $\textit{Pierre
  B\'ezier}$, pronounced ``beh-zeeayr.'' Here is the deal.  Pierre
B\'ezier was an engineer with the Renault car company in the
1960's. He needed a convenient way to draw curves, a way that would
allow curves to be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Easy to render---meaning easy for a computer (or person!) to
  reproduce the curve described by the artist.
\item Easy to transform---meaning easy to manipulate the curve with
  geometric transformations.
\item Easy to draft---meaning easy for an artist to shape a desired
  curve.
\end{enumerate}
Given two end-points, B\'ezier devised a way to work with
curves via a \textit{node} and two
\textit{control points}:\index{node}\index{control-point}
\[
\includegraphics{bezier.pdf}
\]
With the end points remaining fixed, the artist can move the node and
control points to change the way the curve looks.  But how do those
so-called control points actually control the way the curve looks?
Well, the end points, node, and control points define a polygonal path:
\[
\includegraphics{bezierPoly.pdf}
\]
This polygonal path in turn gives an envelope of tangents, which then gives
the desired curve:
\[
\includegraphics{bezierMesh.pdf}
\]
While this may seem all fancy and highfalutin, it is the essence of
B\'ezier's method for drawing curves.  It has become so popular that
this is basically how curves are currently drafted using vector
graphics programs such as \textit{Adobe Illustrator} and
\textit{Inkscape}. Why are B\'ezier curves so popular? We'll see that
they satisfy the requirements above quite well.

\paragraph{Easy to render}
A computer does not draw the parabola via an envelope of
tangents---however, the process we use above can be done by hand. The
key point is that one can obtain an arbitrary amount of smoothness to
the hand-drawn curve by simply adding  more lines to the envelope of tangents.



\paragraph{Easy to transform}
Each curve is completely determined by the polygonal path from the
first end point to first control point to the node to the other
control point and the final end point. Hence, if I simply handed you
five points:
\[
(1,4)\to (4,2)\to (6,6)\to (7,8)\to(9,4)
\]
you can then draw a curve and tell someone else how to draw the exact
same curve. Moreover, you could transform the entire curve merely by
transforming those five points.



\paragraph{Easy to draft}
Of course, as you are aware, most graphic artists don't think much
about coordinates and yet are still able to draw B\'ezier curves with
impunity. This is really the genius of B\'ezier's method. By fixing
the end points, one only need to know the position of the node and the
control points. So by using a mouse, an artist can move the
control points and node to get a plethora of interesting curves.

%% BADBAD REWRITE IN TERMS OF SMOOTHING
\begin{question}
  Suppose you have a $7$-line envelope of tangents. However, it is not
  SMOOTH enough. To SMOOTH the curve, add an additional $8$ lines to
  make a $15$ line envelope of tangents. Check it out:
  \begin{center}
  ORGINAL 7-LINE NEEDS TO BE HERE  \fbox{\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{7-15-lineOfTanEG.png}}
  \end{center}
  Can you figure out how to smooth curves drawn with envelopes of
  tangents?
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Extend an $8$-line envelope of tangents by halving all of
      the ``squares.''  Show off your work by displaying a SCRIPT and
      a STAGE.
    \item Extend a $9$-line envelope of tangents by halving all of the
      ``squares.''  Show off your work by displaying a SCRIPT and a
      STAGE.
    \item Give a general rule for halving all of the ``squares'' of an
      $n$-line envelope of tangents. EXPLAIN WHY the general rule works.
  \end{enumerate}
  As a gesture of friendship, I offer this useful script:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Here is my SCRIPT and my STAGE:

    \item Here is my SCRIPT and my STAGE:

      \end{center}
    \item To halve the ``squares'' of an $n$-line envelope of
      tangents, draw an $(2n+1)$-line envelope of tangents. This works
      because with $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ gaps and $n + n+1 =
      2n+1$.
