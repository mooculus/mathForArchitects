\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Think of infinite classes of symmetries as a single TYPE.
\item Understand horizontal-reflections as compositions of
  translations, rotations, and vertical-reflections.
\item Display a frieze pattern with maximal symmetry.

\begin{question}
  You may have noticed, frieze patterns can have symmetry through
  horizontal-reflections.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Use the INTERNET to look up ``horizontal-reflections.''
    EXPLAIN this symmetry as you would like it explained to you. You
    should use words, pictures, and so on as needed/helpful in your
    explanation.
  \item How does one WITNESS a horizontal-reflection using the
    FRIEZE-EXPLORER-BLOCK?
  \item DISPLAY a frieze pattern with symmetry through translations
    and horizontal-reflections but no others.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A horizontal-reflection is a flip across a vertical line.
    \item You can witness a horizontal-reflection in \snap\ by doing a
      $180^\circ$ rotation and then a vertical-reflection, in either
      order.
    \item Here is my frieze pattern:

\begin{question}
  Let's see what happens when we combine horizontal-reflections with
  other symmetries.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Can you find a frieze pattern that has symmetry through
    glide-reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations but not through
    horizontal-reflections? If YES, show me such a frieze pattern. If
    NO, explain why not.
  \item Can you find a frieze pattern that has symmetry through
    glide-reflections and horizontal-reflections but not through
    $180^\circ$ rotations? If YES, show me such a frieze pattern. If
    NO, explain why not.
  \end{enumerate}
    
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item NO, this cannot be done.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item First think about symmetry through glide-reflections. This
        means that the frieze pattern, when turned upside down, is a
        mirror image of itself.
      \item Next think about the $180^\circ$ rotation. This means that
        the frieze pattern, when turned upside down is unchanged.
      \end{itemize}
      This means that this frieze pattern is it's own mirror image. This
      means that the frieze pattern must have symmetry through
      horizontal-reflections.
    \item NO, this cannot be done.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item First think about symmetry through glide-reflections. This
        means that the frieze pattern, when turned upside down, is a
        mirror image of itself.
      \item Next think about the horizontal-reflection. This means
        that the frieze pattern is it's own mirror image.
      \end{itemize}
      This means that this frieze pattern is it's own mirror image
      when it is upside down, and hence must have symmetry through
      $180^\circ$ rotations.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
  DISPLAY a SINGLE frieze pattern that has symmetry through
  \begin{itemize}
  \item translations,
  \item glide-reflections,
  \item vertical-reflections,
  \item $180^\circ$ rotations, and
  \item horizontal-reflections.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Here it is:
