\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Think of infinite classes of symmetries as a single TYPE.
\item Understand horizontal-reflections as compositions of
  translations, rotations, and vertical-reflections.
\item Display a frieze pattern with maximal symmetry.
\end{listOutcomes}


With the symmetries of any regular $n$-gon, say a SQUARE, we have two TYPES of symmetries:
\[
\underbrace{e,r,r^2,r^3}_{\text{rotations}} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \underbrace{f, rf,r^2f,r^3f}_{\text{flips}}
\]
Let $R$ be some rotation and $F$ be some reflection.
\begin{center}
  What happens when we COMBINE these TYPES?
\end{center}
Well,
\begin{itemize}
\item A rotation combined with a rotation is always a rotation, so we'll write $R \circ R = R$.
\item A flip combined with a rotation is always a flip, so we'll write
  $R\circ F = F \circ R = F$.
\item A flip combined with a flip is always a rotation, so we'll
  write $F\circ F = R$.
\end{itemize}
With this information, we can forget the symmetries themselves, and
just think about the TYPES. In particular, we can make this rather
simple TYPE-multiplication table for ANY regular $n$-gon:
\[
\begin{array}{|c||c|c|}
    \hline
       & R    & F    \\ \hline\hline
    R  & R    & F    \\ \hline
    F  & F    & R    \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]
With frieze patterns we have different TYPES of symmetries. So far we
know frieze patterns can have symmetry through:
\begin{itemize}
\item Translations; let's call a generic translation (perhaps by $0$ units of distance) $T$.
\item Glide-reflection; let's call a generic glide-reflection (perhaps by $0$ units of distance) $G$.
\item Vertical-reflections; let's call a generic vertical-reflection $F_v$.
\item $180^\circ$ rotations; let's call a generic $180^\circ$
  rotation $R$.
\end{itemize}

Immediately we see:
\begin{itemize}
\item A translation combined with a translation is always a
  translation, so we'll write $T\circ T = T$.
\item A translation combined with a glide-reflection is always a
  glide-reflection, so we'll write $T\circ G = G \circ T = T$.
\item A translation combined with a vertical-reflection is always a
  glide-reflection, so we'll write $T\circ F_v = F_v \circ T = G$.
\item A glide-reflection combined with a glide-reflection is always a
  translation, so we'll write $G\circ G = T$.
\item A $180^\circ$ rotation combined with a $180^\circ$ rotation is a
  translation, so we'll write $R\circ R = T$.
\item A vertical-reflection combined with a vertical-reflection
  rotation is a translation (by $0$ units of distance), so we'll write
  $F_v\circ F_v = T$.
\end{itemize}


We will further explore combinations (compositions!) of these symmetries below.







%% Now we are left with several questions:

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item What is a $180^\circ$ rotation combined with a
%%   vertical-reflection?
%% \item What is a $180^\circ$ rotation combined with a glide-reflection?
%% \item What is a glide-reflection combined with a $180^\circ$ rotation?
%% \item What is a translation combined with a $180^\circ$ rotation?
%% \end{itemize}

%% In the questions below, we begin to explore answers to some of these
%% questions.

\begin{question}
  You may have noticed, frieze patterns can have symmetry through
  horizontal-reflections.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Use the INTERNET to look up ``horizontal-reflections.''
    EXPLAIN this symmetry as you would like it explained to you. You
    should use words, pictures, and so on as needed/helpful in your
    explanation.
  \item How does one WITNESS a horizontal-reflection using the
    FRIEZE-EXPLORER-BLOCK?
  \item DISPLAY a frieze pattern with symmetry through translations
    and horizontal-reflections but no others.
  \item   From your work above, FILL-IN the blanks below:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A $180^\circ$ rotation combined with a vertical-reflection
    is a always a \fbox{\phantom{horizontal-reflection}}, so we'll
    write $R\circ F_v = F_v \circ R = \fbox{\phantom{$F_h$}}$.
  \item A $180^\circ$ rotation combined with a glide-reflection
    is a always a \fbox{\phantom{horizontal-reflection}}, so we'll
    write $R\circ G = G \circ R = \fbox{\phantom{$F_h$}}$.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A horizontal-reflection is a flip across a vertical line.
    \item You can witness a horizontal-reflection in \snap\ by doing a
      $180^\circ$ rotation and then a vertical-reflection, in either
      order.
    \item Here is my frieze pattern:
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{ansFv.png}
      \end{center}
    \item For the blanks:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item  A $180^\circ$ rotation combined with a vertical-reflection
        is a always a \fbox{horizontal-reflection}, so we'll
        write $R\circ F_v = F_v \circ R = \fbox{$F_h$}$.
      \item A $180^\circ$ rotation combined with a glide-reflection
        is a always a \fbox{horizontal-reflection}, so we'll
        write $R\circ G = G \circ R = \fbox{$F_h$}$.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{freeResponse}

\begin{question}
  Sometimes, frieze patterns with symmetry through
  horizontal-reflections are unavoidable.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Can you find a frieze pattern that has symmetry through
    vertical-reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations but not through
    horizontal-reflections? If YES, show me such a frieze pattern. If
    NO, explain why not.    
  \item Can you find a frieze pattern that has symmetry through
    glide-reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations but not through
    horizontal-reflections? If YES, show me such a frieze pattern. If
    NO, explain why not.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item NO, this cannot be done. If a frieze pattern has symmetry
      through vertical-reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations, then it
      will also have symmetry through the COMPOSITION of these
      functions. Since we know that
      \[
      R\circ F_v = F_v \circ R = F_h
      \]
      We see that such a frieze pattern must also have symmetry
      through horizontal-reflections.
    \item NO, this cannot be done.  If a frieze pattern has symmetry
      through vertical-reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations, then it
      will also have symmetry through the COMPOSITION of these
      functions. Since we know that
      \[
      R\circ F_v = F_v \circ R = F_h
      \]
      We see that such a frieze pattern must also have symmetry
      through horizontal-reflections.

  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{hint}
    Maybe start by figuring out:
    \[
    F_h \circ F_v = ? \qquad\text{and}\qquad F_h \circ G = ?
    \]
  \end{hint}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Working as we did before, let us first note that
    \[
    F_h \circ F_v = F_h \circ F_v= R
    \]
    We could see this from our work on the symmetry of the square as in that case
    \[
    F_h = f, \qquad F_v = r^2 f, \qquad R = r^2
    \]
    and we know that the reflections commute and 
    \begin{align*}
      F_h \circ F_v &= f \circ r^2 f \\
      &= r^2\\
      &= R.
    \end{align*}
    Moreover, in an entirely similar way, $F_h \circ G = G\circ F_h =
    R$. Putting this together, we find:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item NO, this cannot be done. If a frieze pattern has symmetry
      through horizontal-reflections and vertical-reflections, then it
      will also have symmetry through the COMPOSITION of these
      functions. Since we know that
      \[
      F_h \circ F_v = F_h \circ F_v= R
      \]
      We see that such a frieze pattern must also have symmetry
      through $180^\circ$ rotations.
    \item NO, this cannot be done.  If a frieze pattern has symmetry
      through horizontal-reflections and glide-reflections, then it
      will also have symmetry through the COMPOSITION of these
      functions. Since we know that
      \[
      F_h \circ G = G\circ F_h =
      R
      \]
      We see that such a frieze pattern must also have symmetry
      through $180^\circ$ rotations.
    \end{enumerate}
