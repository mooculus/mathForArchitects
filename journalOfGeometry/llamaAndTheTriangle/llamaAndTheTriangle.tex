\end{listOutcomes}

We are going to investigate why the interior angles of a triangle sum
to $180^\circ$. We won't be alone on this journey; we'll have help.

Louie Llama is rather radical for a llama and doesn't mind being
rotated one bit.

\begin{question}
  Let's take Louie Llama for a walk.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw an obtuse, non-right, scalene triangle. LABEL
    side-lengths and angles.
  \item Now, use your imagination (and artistic skills) to visualize
    Louie Llama walking around the triangle, ALWAYS keeping his FEET
    facing the sides. At EACH VERTEX of the triangle, LABEL the angle
    through which Louie Llama turns.
  \item Write a \snap\ SCRIPT that demonstrates that your answers from
    part (b) are correct. Show off your work by giving screenshots of
    your SCRIPT and your STAGE.
  \end{enumerate}  
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Let's take Louie Llama for a more general walk. 

  
  Write an equation where the right-hand side is Louie Llama's total
  rotation and the left-hand side is the sum of each rotation around
  the angle. Can you solve for $a+b+c$?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Can you walk Louie Llama around other shapes and figure out what the
  sum of their interior angles are? Let's do this with a table:
  \[
    {\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
        $n$-gon & sum of interior angles & interior angle of a regular $n$-gon\\\hline\hline
        3 & & \\\hline
        4 & & \\\hline
        5 & & \\\hline
        6 & & \\\hline
        7 & & \\\hline
        8 & & \\\hline
        $n$ & & \\\hline
    \end{tabular}}
    \]
\end{question}
