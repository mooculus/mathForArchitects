\begin{question}
  Why don't we worry about symmetries through
  glide-horizontal-reflections?
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Having symmetry through so called ``glide-horizontal-reflections''
    is IDENTICAL to having symmetry through
    horizontal-reflections. Behold,

\begin{question}
  Why don't we worry about symmetries through glide-$180^\circ$
  rotations?
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Having symmetry through so called ``glide-$180^\circ$ rotations''
    is IDENTICAL to having symmetry through
    $180^\circ$ rotations. Behold,

\begin{question}
  Explain WHY the TYPES of symmetries for frieze patterns are
  exactly:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item translations,
  \item glide-reflections,
  \item vertical-reflections,
  \item $180^\circ$ rotations, and
  \item horizontal-reflections.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Well, the only symmetries of regular $n$-gons are reflections and
    rotations. The only reflections that a frieze pattern could have
    symmetry through are vertical-reflections and
    horizontal-reflections. Moreover, the only rotations we could
    possibly use are $180^\circ$ rotations, because a frieze is an
    ``infinite'' strip.

    If you combine a translation with a vertical-reflection, you get a
    glide-reflection.

    Moreover, from our work above, we see we don't get any more
    symmetries by combining translations with either
    horizontal-reflections or $180^\circ$ rotations.

    Thus the only possible symmetries for a frieze pattern are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item translations,
    \item glide-reflections,
    \item vertical-reflections,
    \item $180^\circ$ rotations, and
    \item horizontal-reflections.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}
