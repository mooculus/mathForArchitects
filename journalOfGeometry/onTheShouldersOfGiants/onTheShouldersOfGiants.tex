\begin{question}
  A Boeing $747$ weighs around $800,000$ pounds and is around $200$
  feet long.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If you made an exact scale model of a $747$, using all of
      the same materials, that was $1$ foot long, how much would you
      expect it to weigh? Explain your reasoning.
    \item Find an example of an everyday object that weighs about as
      much as your answer to the previous part.
  \end{enumerate}
      \begin{freeResponse}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Well, since the linear scale factor is $1/200$, the volume scale
          factor is $1/200^3$. Hence it would weigh
          \[
          \frac{8\cdot10^5}{200^3} =\frac{8\cdot10^5}{8\cdot 10^6}=1/10~\text{of a pound.}
          \]
        \item Well a tenth of a pound is about $45$ grams. And from
          \begin{center}

          \end{center}
          we see: 10 sheets of paper, 3 empty soda cans, or 2 AA
          batteries. Wow, the plane is light!
        \end{enumerate}
        \end{freeResponse}

\begin{question}
  Again, let's think about a Boeing $747$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item How \textbf{long} is Boeing $747$ in yards? What's the \textbf{scale factor} between feet and yards?
  \item A Boeing $747$ has a wing area of $5650$ square feet. What's the
    \textbf{wing area in square yards}? What's the \textbf{scale factor} between square
    feet and square yards?
  \item What's the \textbf{scale factor} between cubic feet and cubic yards?
  \item What's the connection between ``scale factors'' and ``unit conversions?''
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

%% \begin{question}
%%   Let's think about toy cars and real cars.
%%   \begin{enumerate}
%%     \item If you took a \textit{Hot Wheels} car and made it life size, how much
%%       would it weigh? Find an example of an everyday object that
%%       weighs about as much as your answer.
%%     \item If you took a real car and made it the size of a \textit{Hot Wheels}
%%       car, how much would it weigh? Find an example of an everyday
%%       object that weighs about as much as your answer.
