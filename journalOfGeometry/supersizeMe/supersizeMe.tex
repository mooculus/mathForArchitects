This is Dr.\ Zoidberg:

In the \textit{Futurama} episode \link[\textit{Anthology of Interest
    I}]{https://youtu.be/-IOXv1ysae4} Zoidberg is enlarged to be
approximately $100$ times his normal height. Let's use what we know
about scaling to think about this.

\begin{question}
  Compute the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        height}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal height}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        surface area}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal surface area}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        volume}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal volume}}$
    \end{enumerate}
    In each case, EXPLAIN your reasoning.
\end{question}
\mynewpage


\begin{question}
  Now estimate the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        weight}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal weight}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Amount of Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged ``blood''}}{\text{Amount of Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal ``blood''}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        shell}}{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal shell}}$
  \end{enumerate}
  In each case, EXPLAIN your reasoning.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  I think if I were made $100$ times larger:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item I would suffocate!
  \item Also I would not be able to lift my arms or legs.
  \end{enumerate}
  Can you EXPLAIN why I might think that?
\end{question}
