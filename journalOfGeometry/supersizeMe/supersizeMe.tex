This is Dr.\ Zoidberg:

In the \textit{Futurama} episode \link[\textit{Anthology of Interest
    I}]{https://youtu.be/-IOXv1ysae4} Zoidberg is enlarged to be
approximately $100$ times his normal height. Let's use what we know
about scaling to think about this.

\begin{question}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate tehe 
\item Relative to my eyeball, how much surface area does monster-me's eyeball have?
\item How much does monster-me weigh?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
While you are probably imagining me as some sort of ``car-eating
monster,'' the reality is much different. I claim that monster-me
would have a hard time moving.  Can you explain why this is true?

I also claim that monster-me would suffocate.  Can you explain why
this is true? Hint: How do lungs work? How does oxygen get to the
brain? How much blood would the monster-me have?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
When I was little, I used to want to fold a giant paper airplane and
actually fly around in it. Would this work? Why or why not?
\end{question}
