%% Concrete eg is about scaling length area vol
%% this is about scaling these by a integer factor and connecting to weight and other basic qualities. 







\begin{exercise}
  LEGO has decided to make a ``giant'' version of their plastic
  minifigures that are scale models of regular minifigures, but $5$
  times taller.  How much plastic will be required to make this new
  ``giant'' minifigure?
    \begin{enumerate}\begin{multicols}{2}
    \item $5$ times the original amount.
    \item $25$ times the original amount.
    \item $50$ times the original amount.
    \item $125$ times the original amount.
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}







\begin{exercise}
  Suppose you've designed a concrete statue of a LEGO minifigure.  How
  much will the statue weigh if it's linear dimensions (length,
  height, width) are quadrupled?
  \begin{enumerate}\begin{multicols}{2}
    \item Two times the original weight.
    \item Four times the original weight.
    \item Eight times the original weight.
    \item Sixteen times the original weight.
