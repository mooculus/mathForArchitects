\begin{listSectionOutcomes}
\item Sine and cosine encode information about similar triangles.
\item Sine and cosine can be used to draw circles.
\item The law of sines is useful for finding side lengths of
  triangles.
\item Arccosine finds angles between $0$ and $180$ degrees.
\item The law of cosines is useful for finding angles of triangles.
\item Arctangent is useful for converting a measurement of slope to a
  an angle.

In this section, we review trigonometry from an applied
perspective. This means we focus on \textbf{how to use trigonometry}
to \textbf{solve common problems}.
