\section{Common mistakes}


As humans, our knowledge, and our lack of knowledge are usually
invisible to ourselves. By completing these notes, we hope to
literally enlighten our view of our own knowledge. Novice
mathematicians are overconfident of their knowlege of theorems and
formulas. It is common for them to confuse the formula for the area of
a triangle with the Pythagorean theorem. Moreover, even stating the
Pythagorean theorem is problematic for novices. Novice mathematicians
are quick to make mistakes that ``simplify'' their work. Finally,
novice mathematicians seldom \textbf{reflect} on their work when it is
completed. This results in them often having answers that are
\textbf{obviously wrong}.

\subsection{List of common mistakes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Novice mathematicians have trouble making ``general''
  pictures. For example, if asked to draw a triangle, most novice
  mathematicians will draw an \textbf{equilateral} triangle. This is a
  very \textbf{special triangle} and using this as a tool for
  reasoning about triangles in general is difficult.
\item Novice mathematicians have trouble stating the Pythagorean
  theorem. Usually when asked to state the theorem, they reply
  \[
  a^2+b^2=c^2.
  \]
  \textbf{This is wrong.} The Pythagorean theorem is a theorem
  about \textbf{triangles}. 
\item Novice mathematicians are quick to find a ``formula'' to solve
  the problem, yet often unable to use the formula correctly. Consider
  the formula for the surface area of a pyramid:
  \[
  here
  \]
  STILL HARD
\item When presented with
  \[
  d^2 = a^2 + b^2
  \]
  and asked to simpify, novice mathematicians will often write
  \[
  d = a +b
  \]
  \textbf{This is wrong.} If it were correct, then the
  conclusion of the Pythagorean theorem would be silly!
\item  When presented with
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{a}
  \]
  and asked to simpify, novice mathematicians will often write
  \[
  1+b
  \]
  \textbf{This is wrong.}
\item Novice mathematicians do not reflect on their work. For example
  novice mathematicians have written
  \[
  \frac{10}{2\pi} \approx  15.7\qquad\textbf{this is wrong!}
  \]
  Moreover, it is \textbf{obviously wrong} since $2\pi\approx 6$ and
  $1<\frac{10}{6} <2$. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to
  think about HOW such an error was made.

\section{Structure of the course}





Identify KEY journal entries, and identifying the supporting ones. 


These are the goals: 

Quick questions

Let's apply ourselves

Not so quick questions

Seven types of frieze






This ``geometry journal'' was developed by Dr.\ Jenny Sheldon and
Dr.\ Bart Snapp at The Ohio State University. The content of the
journal is based on work by the above mentioned authors and by
Dr.\ Vic Ferdinand, Dr.\ Bradford Findell, and Dr.\ Herbert Clemens.
And of course, last but not least, YOU!
