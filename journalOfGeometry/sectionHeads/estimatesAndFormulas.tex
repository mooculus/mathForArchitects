\begin{listSectionOutcomes}
\item Apply basic geometric formulas. 
\item Explain why basic geometric formulas are true.
\item Solve real world problems based on scaling.
\item Understand how scaling affects length, area, and
  volume.
\item  Connect length, area, and volume to oper real-world properties of objects.
\end{listSectionOutcomes}

In this section we discuss issues that

\begin{enumerate}
\item Scaling and changing units are identical from a mathematical
  perspective.
\item Scaling can be understood through formulas and through pictures.
\item Ideas are simple, yet powerful.
\item The mathematical theory does model the real world.
\item That while the ideas of scaling are powerful, they cannot be
  applied without thinking.
\end{enumerate}



Measurements of length, area, and volume
computing how  scaling effect length, area, and volume
Conceptualizing the effect of scaling on  length, area, and volume
implications of scaling  length, area, and volume to other measurable quantaties
witnessing the effects of scaling in real life.
understnaing that scaling does not solve all problems.
