\begin{listObjectives}
 \item{Determine a reasonable estimate before preforming a calculation.}
 \item{Increase student confidence in their ability to solve difficult math problems by using previous results, trying different methods, asking questions, and work- ing with others.}
\end{listObjectives}

\begin{listOutcomes}
\item{Edit PDFs to create completed journal entries.}
\item{Hand-in journal entries online.}
\item{Estimate areas and volumes.}
\item{Fill out the Course Survey.}
\item{Create an account on \snap.}
\end{listOutcomes}

This course will involve numerical calculations, but also estimating a reasonable answer before performing calculations. Let's start now!


\begin{question}
Look around our classroom. How many ping pong balls would it take to
\begin{enumerate}
\item Line one edge of the classroom?
 \item Cover the floor?
 \item Fill the room?
\end{enumerate}

You may use any method you like to answer these questions. The only rules are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item You must work with your group.
 \item You may not have extra time.
 \item You must justify your answers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{question}
Look around our classroom. How many play tennis balls would it take to
\begin{enumerate}
\item Line one edge of the classroom?
 \item Cover the floor?
 \item Fill the room?
\end{enumerate}

You may use any method you like to answer these questions. The only rules are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item You must work with your group.
 \item You may not have extra time.
 \item You must justify your answers.
\end{itemize}

\end{question}

The last two questions ask you to fill out the Course Survey and make a Snap! account. These questions are graded as \textbf{Think-Pair-Share}. 
The possible grades are: \emph{Missing, Incomplete} or \emph{Complete}. 

Unlike normal \emph{Think-Pair-Share} questions, both of these questions can be completed outside of class and do not require discussions with your group.

\begin{question}

Go to the course page on Carmen and fill out the \emph{Beginning of Course Survey}.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Go to \flavor and make yourself an account. Prove this to me by
  pasting a screenshot of your \textbf{profile}.
