\begin{question}
  New math is being created all the time. Here are two DIFFICULT math
  problems that were ``recently'' solved:
  \begin{description}
  \item[Four Color Problem] Imagine you have a map of a country or a
    region, and you want to color it in a way that no two neighboring
    areas (like states or counties) have the same color. This means
    that if two areas share a border, they must be colored
    differently. How few colors does it take?
  \item[Einstein Tiling Problem] Is it possible to take these shapes
    and tile them in a way that covers a flat surface, but no matter
    how you try, you can't create a repeating pattern that goes on
    forever without any gaps or overlaps?
  \end{description}
  When were they solved? Why is it called the ``four color'' problem? Why is it called the ``einstein tiling'' problem?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Here is a tiling with the \textbf{hat}.
  \begin{center}

  \end{center}
  Make this BEAUTIFUL by coloring it in with as few colors as possible
  and no adjacent tiles having the same color.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Here is a tiling with the \textbf{spectre}.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=.9]{spectre.png}
  \end{center}
  Make this BEAUTIFUL by coloring it in with as few colors as possible
  and no adjacent tiles having the same color.
