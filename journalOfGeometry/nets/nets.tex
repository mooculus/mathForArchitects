\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Draw nets of cubes.
\item Use nets to find shortest paths on cubes.
\end{listOutcomes}



We are going to think about cubes, how a paper cube could be unfolded, and about paths on these cubes. An unfolded cube is called a \textit{net}.


\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{net}\index{net of a polyhedron} of a polyhedron is a
  single piece arrangement of polygons that are connected along their
  edges so that they can be folded into the polyhedron.
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
  There are $11$ distinct nets for cubes. Use the INTERNET (or your
  brain) to find all $11$ nets for a cube. Carefully draw them here.

\begin{question}
  Here's an old puzzler: Suppose you are an ant standing at the corner
  of a cube whose side length is $10'$. Find and describe the shortest
  path the ant could walk to get to the opposite corner of the cube. What's the
  length of this shortest path?
 %%  Time to think about nets.
%%   \begin{enumerate}
%%   \item Draw all possible nets of regular tetrahedra.
%%   \item Think about building these nets using poster-board and
%%     tape. Which nets would be ``best'' to use and why? Think about
%%     ease of construction, strength of final solid, number of folds,
%%     number of cuts, amount of tape, and \textbf{at least one more}
%%     consideration.

\begin{question}
  Here's another old puzzler: Suppose you are an ant standing $1'$
  directly below the middle of the top edge of a cube whose side
  length is $10'$. Find and describe the shortest path the ant could
  walk to get $1'$ directly above the middle of the opposite (bottom)
  edge of a cube. What's the length of this shortest path?
