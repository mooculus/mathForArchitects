\begin{exercise}
 The sum of the exterior angles of any closed polygon (that doesn't
 cross itself) on a flat surface is $360^\circ$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
 Consider the following equation:
 \[
 (80-\alpha)+(80-\beta)+(80-\gamma)=50.
 \]
 Solve for $\alpha+\beta+\gamma$.
\end{exercise}






\begin{exercise}
 You draw an angle with the vertex is in the center of the paper, and
 whose sides extend to the edges of the paper. You then cut one of the
 sides and make a cone. A triangle drawn on the cone, around the
 vertex will have:
 
\begin{enumerate}
\begin{multicols}{3}
 \item Angles sum to less than $180^\circ$
 \item Angles sum to $180^\circ$
 \item Angles sum to more than $180^\circ$
\end{multicols}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
