%% \begin{prob}
%% Put a dot at the center of a blank sheet of paper and call it $\vec{o}$.
%% Use a protractor to draw an angle of $50^\circ$ with vertex at the
%% point $\vec{o}$ and sides extending all the way out to the edge of the
%% paper.  Cut the paper along one side of the angle and one side only.
%% Make a cone by moving the cut edge to the other side of the angle you
%% drew.  This cone (extended infinitely) is your universe.
%% \end{prob}


%% \begin{prob}
%% Make a triangle in your universe that surrounds $\vec{o}$. To do this,
%% unfold your universe and lay it out flat on the desk and make the
%% sides with your ruler.  When a side gets to the cut side of your
%% angle, put the other side of the angle on top and keep going.
%% \end{prob}

%% \begin{prob}
%% You measure angles on your universe by laying the paper out flat and
%% measuring the angles on the paper. Measure the angles in your
%% triangle.  What do they sum to?
%% \end{prob}


%% \begin{prob}
%% Repeat the problems above, but this time cut an angle of $40^\circ$ to
%% make your cone. What do you notice?
%% \end{prob}

%% Let's see if we can explain this. Do you know who is eager to help
%% you? That's right: Louie Llama.

%% \begin{prob}
%% Take your triangle and denote the measure of its angles as $a$, $b$,
%% and $c$. We would like to parade Louie around the triangle. There is
%% only one catch: What happens to Louie when he passes over the ``cut?''
%% Draw some pictures and see if you can figure it out.
%% \end{prob}

%% Start Louie Llama out along a side adjacent to the angle of measure
%% $a$. He should be on the outside of the triangle, his feet should be
%% pointing toward the triangle, and his face should be pointing toward
%% the angle of measure $b$. Continue this process and walk him all
%% around the triangle. When he gets to the ``cut'' put the paper
%% together, and let him continue his walk.

%% \begin{prob} 
%% Through what angle does Louie rotate when he strolls around a vertex?
%% \end{prob}

%% \begin{prob}
%% How many degrees did the ``cut'' rotate Louie? 
%% \end{prob}

%% \begin{prob} 
%% All in all, how many degrees did Louie Llama rotate in his walk?
%% \end{prob}


%% \begin{prob}
%% If a cone is made on a sheet of paper with a cut of $\theta$ degrees,
%% and a triangle is made surrounding the point of the cone, what is the
%% sum of the degrees of this triangle?
%% \end{prob}
