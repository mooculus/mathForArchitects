We're going to study geometry on a CONE. To do this, we need to
PHYSICALLY MAKE A CONE.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Get a blank sheet of paper.
\item Use a protractor to draw a $50^\circ$ angle whose
  \begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{vertex}] is in the \textbf{center of the paper}, and whose
    \item[\textbf{legs}] extend to the \textbf{edges} of the paper.
  \end{description}
  \item Lightly SHADE the interior of the angle.
  \item Use scissors to cut the paper along \textbf{one leg} of the
    angle and one side only.
  \item Make a cone by moving the \textbf{cut} to the other leg of the
    angle. When you do this, the \textbf{shaded region should be covered}.
\end{enumerate}

Now we'll draw a TRIANGLE on the cone that surrounds the vertex of the
cone. To do this,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unfold your cone and lay it flat. Lines that don't cross the
  non-shaded region are drawn as usual.
\item When a line gets to the SHADED region, fold the paper to \textbf{hide
  the shaded region} and keep drawing.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
   You measure angles on your cone by laying the paper flat and
   measuring the angles on the paper.
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item Measure the angles in your triangle on the cone.  What do
       they sum to?
     \item Repeat the problems above, but this time cut an angle of
       $40^\circ$ to make your cone. What do you notice?
   \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Let's see if we can explain this. Do you know who is eager to help
you? That's right: Louie Llama.

\end{center}

Lable the measure of your triangles angles as $\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$\gamma$. We would like to parade Louie around the triangle.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Through what angle does Louie rotate when he strolls around a
  vertex?
\item How many degrees did the ``cut'' rotate Louie? 
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}

\mynewpage


\begin{question}
If a cone is made on a sheet of paper with a cut of $\theta$ degrees,
and a triangle is made surrounding the point of the cone, what is the
sum of the degrees of this triangle?
\end{question}
