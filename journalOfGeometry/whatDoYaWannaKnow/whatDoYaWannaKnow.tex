You've designed a roughly spherical water tank:

Below, let's think about some questions.



\mynewpage



\begin{question} %% BY L
  Your client wants to know how the DIAMETER of the of water tank will
  change if the radius is reduced by $10\%$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What additional information (if any) do you need/would like
    to answer this question?
  \item \textbf{Without working hard, or looking anything up,} what's
    your \textbf{BEST GUESS} as to what the answer is?
  \item How does your answer above change if we instead INCREASE the
    radius by $10\%$?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\mynewpage


\begin{question} %% BY SA
  Your client wants to know how the COST of the RAW MATERIALS for the
  water tank will change if the radius is reduced by $10\%$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What additional information (if any) do you need/would like
    to answer this question?
  \item \textbf{Without working hard, or looking anything up,} what's
    your \textbf{BEST GUESS} as to what the answer is?
  \item How does your answer above change if we instead INCREASE the
    radius by $10\%$?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\mynewpage


\begin{question} %% BY VOL
  Your client wants to know how the WEIGHT of the full tank will
  change if the radius is reduced by $10\%$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What additional information (if any) do you need/would like
    to answer this question?
  \item \textbf{Without working hard, or looking anything up,} what's
    your \textbf{BEST GUESS} as to what the answer is?
  \item How does your answer above change if we instead INCREASE the
    radius by $10\%$?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
