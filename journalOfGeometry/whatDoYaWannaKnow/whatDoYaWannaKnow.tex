\begin{question} %% BY L
  Your client wants to know how the \emph{diameter} of the of water tank will
  change if the radius is reduced by $10\%$.
  
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item[\emph{Think:}] Take one minute and answer the following questions. Write down your answers here. When you turn in the assignment, remember to include your original answers from this part.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What additional information (if any) do you need/would like
    to answer this question?
    \vspace{1in}
  \item Without looking anything up, what's
    your best guess as to what the answer is?
        \vspace{.5in}

  \item How does your answer above change if we instead increase the
    radius by $10\%$?
        \vspace{.5in}

  \end{enumerate}
  
  \item[\emph{Group:}] Discuss your answers with your group. Do your answers change? What is your group's justification for your answers. Record your responses here.
  
  \vfill
  \item[\emph{Share:}] Have someone from your group share your answers and justifications with the class. Record any changes you would make based on the class discussion.
