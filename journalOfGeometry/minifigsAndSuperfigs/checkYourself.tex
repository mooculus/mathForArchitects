%% Concrete eg is about scaling length area vol
%% this is about scaling these by a integer factor and connecting to weight and other basic qualities. 







\begin{exercise}
  LEGO has decided to make a ``giant'' version of their plastic
  minifigures that are scale models of regular minifigures, but $5$
  times taller.  How much plastic will be required to make this new
  ``giant'' minifigure?
    \begin{enumerate}\begin{multicols}{2}
    \item $5$ times the original amount.
    \item $25$ times the original amount.
    \item $50$ times the original amount.
    \item $125$ times the original amount.
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}%%%%answer key had volume, but shouldn't this be surface area?
\end{exercise}







\begin{exercise}
  Suppose you've designed a concrete statue of a LEGO minifigure.  How
  much will the statue weigh if its linear dimensions (length,
  height, width) are quadrupled?
  \begin{enumerate}\begin{multicols}{2}
    \item Four times the original weight.
    \item Sixteen times the original weight.
    \item Thirty-two times the original weight.
    \item Sixty-four times the original weight.
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
  Suppose you measure the amount of water that fills a small bowl. You
  realize this bowl happens to be a scale model of a kiddie-pool. If
  the kiddie-pool is $10$ times wider than the bowl, about how much
  more water does the kiddie-pool hold?
  \begin{enumerate}\begin{multicols}{2}
  \item Around $10$ times as much water.
  \item Around $50$ times as much water.
  \item Around $100$ times as much water.
  \item Around $500$ times as much water.
  \item Around $1,000$ times as much water.
  \item Around $5,000$ times as much water.
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
You've designed a helium balloon in the shape of a
LEGO minifigure. Currently you have a model that is $1$ meter tall.  How
much more fabric will be needed if your model is scaled to be $30$
meters tall?
\begin{enumerate}\begin{multicols}{2}
  \item $30$ times the amount of fabric in the model.
  \item $300$ times the amount of fabric in the model.
  \item $900$ times the amount of fabric in the model.
  \item $2,700$ times the amount of fabric in the model.
  \item $9,000$ times the amount of fabric in the model.
  \item $27,000$ times the amount of fabric in the model.
  \end{multicols}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
You've designed a helium balloon in the shape of a LEGO minifigure. If
the minifigure balloon requires around $27,000$ square feet of fabric,
about how much fabric will be required in square meters to complete
the balloon?
\begin{enumerate}\begin{multicols}{2}
  \item About $100$ square meters of fabric.
  \item About $300$ square meters of fabric.
  \item About $1,000$ square meters of fabric.
  \item About $3,000$ square meters of fabric.
  \item About $10,000$ square meters of fabric.
  \item About $30,000$ square meters of fabric.
  \end{multicols}
\end{enumerate}
