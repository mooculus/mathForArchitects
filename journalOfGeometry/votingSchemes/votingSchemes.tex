\end{listOutcomes}


Suppose you are voting for a possible type of pet to live in your
appartment building. Of the $38$ residents that live in your building:

\begin{itemize}
\item $16$ residents prefer dogs, better than cats, better than no pets at all.
\item $4$ residents prefer cats, better than dog,s better than no pets at all.
\item $18$ residents prefer no pets at all, better than cats, better
  than dogs.
\end{itemize}

If we can only allow one of the options: dogs, cats, no pets at all;
how shall we decide?
