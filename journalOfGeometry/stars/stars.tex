Can you remember when you first learned to draw a star? I can! I was first taught to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{bartTri.pdf}
\]
But I wanted to know how to draw 5-pointed stars like the other
kids. So one day I taught myself to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{bartTri2.pdf}
\]
This may seem like a silly way to draw this star---it certainly makes
me chuckle now. Let's see if we can give a theory for drawing stars
that will connect the two different stars above, teach you how to
draw some new stars, and learn a little more mathematics along the
way.


We'll start with $5$ points equally spaced on a circle:
\[
\includegraphics{stfive.pdf}
\]
Think of these points as \textit{pins}.  Next we'll start at the top
and draw lines that we'll think of as \textit{strings}, moving
clockwise to the point two steps away each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stfive1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive3.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive5.pdf}
\]
Check it out, we got a star! If we had used pins and string to make
this star, we could have done it with one piece of string.



Now start with $6$ points equally spaced on a circle. Again, we'll
move clockwise two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stsix1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix3.pdf}
\]
Oops, we've run out of points! No worries, just start again at one of
the points that hasn't been touched by a line yet, drawing lines and
moving two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stsix4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix5.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix6.pdf}
\]
Ah! The other star! In this case, if we used pins and strings, we'd
need to use \textit{two} pieces of string.


I'm hoping that the following notation will help out:
\[
\stringstar{n}{s}=\left[\begin{minipage}{3.7in}
the star with $n$ equally spaced points where we move $s$ steps clockwise
\end{minipage}\right]
\]
Remember, $\stringstar{n}{s}$ is a star, \textbf{not} a fraction!
Stars can be drawn in \snap\ with this block:

\begin{question}
  Some stars with different numbers look the same. For example:
  \[
  \stringstar{12}{3}\quad\text{and}\quad\stringstar{12}{9}
  \]
look the same.  Use
\raisebox{-.4\height}{\includegraphics{starBlock.png}} to investigate
which stars look the same.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assume that $0 < s < t< n$.  GIVE A GENERAL RULE for when the
    stars stars $\stringstar{n}{s}$ and $\stringstar{n}{t}$ look the
    same.
  \item EXPLAIN WHY your rule is true.
  \item What if $s$ or $t$ are bigger than $n$? MODIFY your rule to
    account for this and EXPLAIN WHY your new rule is true.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{freeResponse}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A star $\stringstar{n}{s}$ looks the same as $\stringstar{n}{t}$ for
    $0 < s < t< n$ when $n=s+ t$.
  \item This is true, because you are just drawing the star ``backwards.''
  \item If $s$ and $t$ can be bigger than $n$, then we modify the
    rule to be: A star $\stringstar{n}{s}$ looks the same as
    $\stringstar{n}{t}$ for $0 < s < t< n$ when $n$ is a factor of
    $s+t$. In essence, we just spin around the circle more times
    before we put our point down.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}
\mynewpage

\begin{question}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Give a precise DESCRIPTION of what happens when we ``reduce to
    lowest terms.'' As an example, think about how the stars
    $\stringstar{6}{2}$ and $\stringstar{3}{1}$ are related.
  \item EXPLAIN WHY your description holds.
  \end{enumerate}
  As a gesture of friendship, I suggest you check out (and play with!)
  this script:

  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item When we ``reduce'' a star, we find the piece it is made
        of.  The star
        \[
        \stringstar{12}{4}
        \]
        is made of pieces of $\stringstar{3}{1}$, and the fraction
        \[
        \frac{12}{4} = \frac{3}{1}.
        \]
      \item This happens, because of how stars work, and how fractions reduce.

\[
        \frac{x\cdot p}{y\cdot q} =  
\]
        
    \end{enumerate}

  Demonstrate a working understanding by using \snap\ to draw the
  following stars for me:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A star, made of $3$ separate $\stringstar{5}{2}$ stars.
   \item A star, with $21$ points and $7$ pieces. 
   \item A star, with $21$ points made of separate $\stringstar{7}{2}$
     stars.
  \end{enumerate}
  Use \snap\ to show off your work by giving screenshots of your
  SCRIPTS and STAGES.
