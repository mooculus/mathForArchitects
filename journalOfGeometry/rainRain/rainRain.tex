Check out this dialogue between two students (based on a true story):

\begin{mdframed}[style=OutcomeStyle]
  \begin{quote}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, there was a lot of rain last night.
\item[Riley] April showers make May flowers. 
\item[Devyn] I left my $1'$ diameter soup-pot out in the rain, it's
  filled with water---it was empty before it started raining.
\item[Riley] Hmm. I left my $6'$ diameter kiddie-pool out in the rain.
  It was also emptied before the rain, and now it is full of water.
\item[Devyn] I'm sure the water level in my soup-pot is higher,
  because there is less volume to fill.
\item[Riley] No way! Since my kiddie-pool collected more rain (it's
  bigger yo!) the water level is higher in my pool.
\end{dialogue}
  \end{quote}
\end{mdframed}
We'll think about this conversation. 




\mynewpage


\begin{question}
  Both the soup-pot and the kiddie-pool are approximately cylinders.
  After chatting for sometime, Devyn and Riley decide that height of
  the WATER-LEVEL in the cylinder is either
  \begin{itemize}
  \item proportional to the diameter of the cylinder, or
  \item proportional to the area of the base of the cylinder.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Which of the guesses above is correct? EXPLAIN your reasoning.
  \item Suppose Devyn and Riley sloppily measure the water level. Could
    even a ``sloppy'' measurement deduce which guess above is correct?
    EXPLAIN your reasoning.
  \end{enumerate}
  As a gesture of friendship, I'll remind you that a value $x$ is \textbf{proportional} to a value $y$ if
  \[
  x = k y
  \]
  where $k$ is a constant.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  You find this random math work scribbled somewhere:
  \begin{align}
    A \cdot h &= \text{volume of rain in cylinder}\\
    A \cdot k &= \text{amount of rain in cylinder}\\
    A\cdot h &= A\cdot k\\
    h &= k
  \end{align}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item EXPLAIN and JUSTIFY each line above, and EXPLAIN how it solves
    the question of ``which water level is higher.''
  \item Remind us what $h$ and $k$ represent. Is it strange that
    $h=k$? EXPLAIN why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
\mynewpage


\begin{question}
  Devyn and Riley go to move their cylinders without dumping the
  water. Devyn's weighs around $10$ pounds. At this point their mutual
  acquaintance, \textit{Geometry Giorgio} shows up and claims:
  \begin{quote}
    Since Devyn's soup-pot and water weigh $10$ pounds, and Riley's
    kiddie pool has $6$ times the diameter, then Riley's kiddie-pool
    and water must weigh $10\cdot 6 = 60$ pounds.
  \end{quote}
  \textbf{Is Geometry Giorgioâ€™s claim correct?  If so, EXPLAIN why. If
    not, explain why not and give a correct solution.}
\end{question}
