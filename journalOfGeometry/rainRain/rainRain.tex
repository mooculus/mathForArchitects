Check out this dialogue between two students (based on a true story):

\begin{mdframed}[style=OutcomeStyle]
  \begin{quote}
\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, there was a lot of rain last night.
\item[Riley] April showers make May flowers. 
\item[Devyn] I left my $1'$ diameter soup-pot out in the rain, it's
  filled with water---it was empty before it started raining.
\item[Riley] Hmm. I left my $6'$ diameter kiddie-pool out in the rain.
  It was also emptied before the rain, and now it is full of water.
\item[Devyn] I'm sure the water level in my soup-pot is higher,
  because there is less volume to fill.
\item[Riley] No way! Since my kiddie-pool collected more rain (it's
  bigger yo!) the water level is higher in my pool.

We'll think about this conversation.




\mynewpage


\begin{question}
  Both the soup-pot and the kiddie-pool are approximately cylinders.
  After chatting for sometime, Devyn and Riley decide that height of
  the WATER-LEVEL in the cylinder is either
  \begin{itemize}
  \item proportional to the diameter of the cylinder, or
  \item proportional to the area of the base of the cylinder.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Which of the guesses above is correct? EXPLAIN your reasoning.
  \item Suppose Devyn and Riley slopply measure the water level. Could
    even a ``sloppy'' measurement deduce which guess above is correct?
    EXPLAIN your reasoning.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  You find this random math work scribbled somewhere:
  \begin{align}
    A \cdot h &= \text{volume of rain in cylinder}\\
    A \cdot k &= \text{amount of rain in cylinder}\\
    A\cdot h &= A\cdot k\\
    h &= k
  \end{align}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item EXPLAIN and JUSTIFY each line above, and EXPLAIN how it solves
    the question of ``which water level is higher.''
  \item Remind us what $h$ and $k$ represent. Is it strange that
    $h=k$? EXPLAIN why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
\mynewpage


\begin{question}
 Devyn and Riley go to move their cylinders. Devyn picks-up theirs
 with ease. Riley is having more trouble. Why?
\end{question}
