\begin{question}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw a point $O$ sitting at the intersection of a horizontal
    and vertical line.
  \item Draw a vertical line segment $\bar{OS}$ where $S$ is directly
    above $O$ and $|OS|$ is equal to the smaller pitch.
  \item Starting from $S$, draw a line with the larger pitch in a
    downward direction, call the intersection of this line with the
    horizontal line point $X$.
  \item Starting at point $O$, extend the line segment $\bar{OS}$ by
    drawing downward $12$ units, and call the lowest point of this
    segment $L$.
  \item The slope you seek is:
    \[
    \frac{|OS|}{|LX|}\qquad \text{with a pitch of} \qquad \frac{12\cdot |OS|}{|LX|}
    \]
