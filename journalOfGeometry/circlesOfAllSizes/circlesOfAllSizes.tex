\begin{question}
  I was reading some fancy math the other day, it said for any shape
  of area $A$, the perimeter of this shape is $P$ where:
  \[
  P \ge \frac{4\pi A}{C^2}
  \]
  Use the fact that a circle is the two dimensional shape of greatest
  area for a given perimeter to deduce the inequality above.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
\textbf{Radians} are a way to measure angles that connect the radius
of a circle to its perimeter. $1 \ radian$ is the \textbf{angle made}
when we \textbf{wrap a radius around the perimeter of a circle.} On a
circle with radius $1\ unit$, the length of the thick arc is also
$1\ unit$, so the marked angle has measure $1 \ radian$.

The ever insightful Louie Llama is here to help!

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Louie Llama walks all the way around the  the circle. When he gets back to where he started, he has turned $2\pi \ rad$. Explain why in your own words. 
    \item What is the length of thick segment if $\theta=\pi \ rad$? Why?
    \item What is the length of the blue segment if $\theta=1 \ rad$ and the radius is $r$? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question} %% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_girdling_Earth 
  Here a problem that is at least $300$ years old, so let's call it an  ``oldie, but a goodie!''
  \begin{quote}
    Imagine a chain, pulled tight around the Earth's equator. Suppose
    you add an extra $10'$ to the chain. The chain is then raised up
    uniformly, all around the Earth, as high as possible. How high is
    that?
  \end{quote}
  Supposing that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There are $5280$ feet in a mile, and
  \item the radius of the Earth is $4000$ miles,
  \end{itemize}
  it is now time for you to try you hand at this classic.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Give a solution in feet. Show all work.
  \item Is the answer surprising? Explain why you say yes or no.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}
