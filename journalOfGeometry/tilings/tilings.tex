angles.

\maketitle

\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Give informal definitions of tessellation, polygon, and
  symmetry.
\item Identify regular polygons that tile the plane.
\item Give arguments demonstrating which regular polygons cannot tile
  the plane.
\item Pose questions about tilings of the plane with irregular
  polygons, or using multiple regular polygons.
\end{listOutcomes}

%% \begin{listObjectives}
%%  \item Learn and apply basic geometric formulas,
%% \item Explain why presented concepts and formulas are true,
%% \item Determine if a shape can be used as a tile for tessellations.
%% \end{listObjectives}

We want to determine which regular polygons (polygons where all sides
have equal length and all angles have equal measure) can be used as to
tile the plane.
 
These questions can be extended to non-regular polygons, like
rectangles, or uses more than one polygon at once. But for today, we
want to only use one shape.

\begin{question}
We call mathematical tilings `tessellations.' Today we are going to
talk about tessellation of a flat surface.

What would be a reasonable definition of a tessellation with one
shape? Here are two examples that are not tessellations, and one that
is. Use these to help come up with a definition of a tessellation.

	\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{pentagons} \quad
	%\caption{Not valid because of overlap}
	\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{crosses}
	%\caption{Valid}
\end{center}

\end{question}

\begin{question}
 Now we are going to use these shapes to try to create a tiling. Work
 with your groups to fill out the following table.  If you cannot
 create a tessellation with a given polygon, give the range for the
 ``number around a vertex.''

The last column is also one of the columns in the \emph{Louie Llama and the Triangle} assignment.
\[
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|p{1.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|}\hline
Shape & Number of Sides & Number around vertex & Tile? & Interior Angle Measure \\ \hline\hline
Triangle & 3 &  &  & \\ \hline
Square & 4 &  &  & \\ \hline
Pentagon & 5  &  &  & \\ \hline
Hexagon & 6 &  &  & \\ \hline
Heptagon & 7 &  &  & \\ \hline
Octagon & 8 &  &  & \\ \hline\hline
n-gon & n &  &  & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\]
\end{question}
\mynewpage

\begin{question}
 Are these the only possible tessellations with regular polygons? If not, explain which ones are missing.
 
 Once you have a complete list, explain how you know that there are no other options.
\end{question}
