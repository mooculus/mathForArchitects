\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Determine which regular polygons can tiles.

\maketitle

\begin{listOutcomes}
 \item Give informal definitions of tessellation, polygon, and symmetry.
\item Prove and disprove tilings of the plane by regular polygons using manipulatives.
\item Pose questions about tilings of the plane with irregular polygons, or using multiple regular polygons.
\end{listOutcomes}

\begin{listObjectives}
 \item Learn and apply basic geometric formulas,
\item Explain why presented concepts and formulas are true,
\item Determine if a shape can be used as a tile for tessellations.
\end{listObjectives}

 We want to determine which regular polygons (ie, a polygon where all sides have equal length and all angles have equal measure) can be used as a tile.
 
 These questions can be extended to non-regular polygons, like rectangles, or uses more than one polygon at once. But for today, we want to only use one shape.

\begin{question}
We call mathematical tilings ‘tessellations.’ Today we are going to talk about tessellation of a flat surface.
\begin{itemize}
 \item[\emph{Think:}] What would be a reasonable definition of a tessellation with one shape? Here are two examples that are not tessellations, and one that is. Use these to help come up with a definition of a tessellation.

\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.3\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{crosses}
	%\caption{Valid}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
\item[\emph{Group:}] Discuss your definition with your group. What changes do you need to make so that your definition makes sense to others?
\item[\emph{Share:}] Are there any additional changes you need to make based on the class discussion?
\end{itemize}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
 Now we are going to use these shapes to try to create a tiling. Work with your groups to fill out the following table. 
If you cannot create a tessellation with a given polygon, leave the ``number around a vertex" box blank.

The last column is also one of the columns in the \emph{Louie Llama and the Triangle} assignment.
\[
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|p{1.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|}\hline
Shape & Number of Sides & Number around vertex & Tile? & Interior Angle Measure \\ \hline
Triangle & 3 &  &  & \\ \hline
Square & 4 &  &  & \\ \hline
Pentagon & 5  &  &  & \\ \hline
Hexagon & 6 &  &  & \\ \hline
Heptagon & 7 &  &  & \\ \hline
Octagon & 8 &  &  & \\ \hline
n-gon & n &  &  & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\]
\end{question}
\mynewpage

\begin{question}
 Are these the only possible tessellations with regular polygons? If not, explain which ones are missing.
 
 Once you have a complete list, explain how you know that there are no other options.
\end{question}
