This is Dr.\ Zoidberg:

In the \textit{Futurama} episode \link[\textit{Anthology of Interest
    I}]{https://youtu.be/-IOXv1ysae4} Zoidberg is enlarged to be
approximately $100$ times his normal height. Let's use what we know
about scaling to think about this.

\begin{question}
  Compute the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        height}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal height}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        surface area}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal surface area}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        volume}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal volume}}$
    \end{enumerate}
    In each case, EXPLAIN your reasoning.
    \begin{freeResponse}
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Well,
        \[
        \frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
            height}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal height}} = 100.
        \]
      \item And,
        \[
        \frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
            surface area}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal surface area}} = 100^2 = 10000
        \]
        because when you scale linear lengths by a factor, you scale
        the area by the square of the factor.
      \item Finally,
        \[
        \frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
            volume}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal volume}} = 100^3 = 1000000
        \]
        because when you scale linear lengths by a factor, you scale
        the volume by the cube of the factor.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Now estimate the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        weight}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal weight}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Amount of Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged ``blood''}}{\text{Amount of Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal ``blood''}}$
    \item $\frac{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        shell}}{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal shell}}$
  \end{enumerate}
  In each case, DISCUSS how you arrived at your answer.
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item So,
      \[
      \frac{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
        weight}}{\text{Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal weight}} = 100^3
      \]
      because volume determines weight!
    \item In this case:
      \[
      \frac{\text{Amount of Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged ``blood''}}{\text{Amount of Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal ``blood''}} = 100^3
      \]
      because volume determines the amount of blood!
    \item This one is tricky. If Zoidberg's shell is very thin, the answer will be closer to
      \[
      \frac{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
          shell}}{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal shell}} = 100^2
      \]
      because the weight of a thin shell will be determined by its
      area. On the other hand, if there is a significant thickness to the shell then  the answer will be closer to:
      \[
      \frac{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's enlarged
          shell}}{\text{Weight of Dr.\ Zoidberg's normal shell}} = 100^3
      \]
      because volume determines weight.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
  I think if I were made $100$ times larger:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item I would suffocate!
  \item Also I would not be able to lift my arms or legs.
  \end{enumerate}
  Can you EXPLAIN why I might think that?

  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The amount of blood one has is determined by volume, but the
      amount of oxygen our lungs can absorb is determined by surface
      area. So I would have $1000000$ times more blood, but only
      $10000$ times as much surface area to acquire oxygen. Hence it
      would be as if I was getting $1/100$ of the amount of air I
      needed.
    \item So, your muscles work by contracting ``strings,'' and
      stronger muscles have more of these strings. Hence the strength
      of a muscle is determined by its cross-sectional area. Since the
      weight of me, $100$ times larger is $1000000$ more, and my
      strength is only $10000$ more, I would be $100$ times weaker
      than I am. I don't think I would be able to move. 
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{freeResponse}
  
\end{question}
