  Drawing pictures in \LOGO\ often means making the turtle do things
  over and over again. The drawing-turtle doesn't mind, but there are
  efficient ways to communicate. One way is the \lc{repeat} command.
\begin{logo}
repeat 4 [
  fd 100
  lt 90
  ]
\end{logo}

Which produces a square. We can name this procedure \lc{square} (or
\lc{susan} or \lc{bob}) by using \lc{to} \dots \lc{end}:

\begin{logo}
to square
  repeat 4 [ fd 100 lt 90 ]
end
\end{logo}
Now the code above draws NOTHING. To make it draw something, add the command \lc{square} at the end:
\begin{logo}
to square
  repeat 4 [ fd 100 lt 90 ]
end
square  
\end{logo}
This draws:
\begin{logoout}
\begin{tikzpicture}[turtle/distance=2cm]
  \draw [thick,black,turtle={home,forward,left,forward,left,forward,left,forward}];
  \node at (0,0) {\turtle};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{logoout}

Now that we have \lc{square} around, we can repeat it too! We'll draw a flower:

\begin{logo}
ht setcolor 1 fill 
setwidth 20 setcolor 2
bk 300
setwidth 100
lt 90 
fd 800
pu home pd
setwidth 10 setcolor 6-random 4
repeat 12 [square rt 30]
\end{logo}
\begin{logoout}
    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{flower.png}
\end{logoout}

Now for your challenge, you'll make a field of flowers!

\section{Commands to know}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  \lc{CMD}   & Description                 \\ \hlinewd{1pt}
  \lc{repeat \# [ BODY ]} & \lc{BODY} repeats \lc{\#} times  \\
  \lc{to NAME BODY end}   & a new command \lc{NAME}\\
  \lc{setcolor \#}   & set the color to \lc{\#} \\
  \lc{fill} & bucket fill \\ 
  \lc{setwidth \#}   & set pen width \lc{\#}\\
  \lc{random \#}     & \begin{minipage}[t]{2in}random number between $0$ and $\lc{\#} -1$\end{minipage}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
  Above, there is code that draws a flower. Explain in words what each
  line of the code does.
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
  Make a command \lc{flower} that will make a small version ($\sim 50$
  units tall) of the flower above.  Show your code and your picture.
\end{problem}

\newpage


\begin{problem}
  What direction is the turtle facing after your flower command is
  made? Explain how you know with words/pictures.
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
  Make a command \lc{patch} that will make a `patch' of three flowers
  in a row.  Show your code and your picture. 
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
  Make a command \lc{field} that will produce a field of color
  \lc{[80 100 80]} covered in patches of flowers. Show your
  code and your picture.
\end{problem}
