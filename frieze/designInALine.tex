\maketitle

In design and architecture, a \index{frieze pattern}\textit{frieze},
pronounced ``freeze,'' is a horizontal band that is found near the
ceiling or roof. It is often decorated with a repeating design. Let's
see some examples:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fpfrieze.pdf}
\end{center}
In each case, the pattern above can be thought of as an infinite strip
with the pattern continuing indefinitely.  Frieze patterns often have
symmetry in their structure. While in real-life, the symmetry would
not be perfect, it is useful in mathematics to simplify reality by
replacing the real patterns by idealized designs.  In this chapter, we
will study the symmetry of frieze patterns. At this point we will
refrain from giving a rigorous definition of a \textit{frieze
  pattern}. Instead, this will be a result of our work in this
chapter.

\section{Symmetries}

\subsection*{Translations}\index{translation}

Perhaps the most apparent symmetry that frieze patters can exhibit is
symmetry through \textit{horizontal translations}:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fptrans.pdf}
\end{center}
We will not only insist that a frieze pattern always have
translational symmetry, but we will also insist that such a
translation is \textit{discrete}, meaning that it occurs in distinct
``hops'' of some minimal distance. So, for example, the while the
following patterns have minimal discrete translations, 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fptransDis.pdf}
\end{center}
this pattern
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fptransNot.pdf}
\end{center}
does not, and hence will not technically be considered a frieze
pattern. To be completely explicit: 
\begin{center}
\textbf{All frieze patterns have symmetry through a minimal discrete
  horizontal translation.}
\end{center}
\begin{definition}\index{minimal cell}
A \textbf{minimal cell} is the smallest slice of a frieze
pattern that will produce the entire frieze pattern through horizontal
translations.
\end{definition}

\begin{warning}
The minimal cell of a frieze pattern is not unique! Consider
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fptransMinEG.pdf}
\end{center}
both
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fptransMinEGCell.pdf} \qquad\text{and}\qquad  \includegraphics{fptransMinEGCell2.pdf}
\end{center}
are minimal cells.
\end{warning} 



\subsection*{Horizontal Reflections}\index{horizontal reflection}

Frieze patterns can have symmetry through \textit{horizontal reflections}:
\[
\includegraphics{fphoriz.pdf}
\]
Some frieze patterns have symmetry through horizontal reflections, while
others don't.
\begin{question} 
Can you identify the frieze patterns below with symmetry through
horizontal reflections?
\[
\includegraphics{fpfriezeHoriz.pdf}
\]
\end{question}

\begin{warning}
Remember: A horizontal reflection reflects across a vertical line!
\end{warning}



\subsection*{Vertical Reflections}\index{vertical reflection}


Frieze patterns can have symmetry through \textit{vertical reflections}:
\[
\includegraphics{fpvertical.pdf}
\]

\begin{question}
Can you identify the frieze patterns below with symmetry through
vertical reflections?
\[
\includegraphics{fpfriezeVert-Horiz.pdf}
\]
\end{question}

\begin{warning}
Remember: A vertical reflection reflects across a horizontal
line!
\end{warning}




\subsection*{Glide Reflections}\index{glide reflection}

Frieze patterns can have symmetry through \textit{glide reflections}:
\[
\includegraphics{fpglide.pdf}
\]

\begin{question}
Can you identify the frieze patterns below with symmetry through glide
reflections?
\[
\includegraphics{fpfriezeGlide.pdf}
\]
\end{question}

\begin{question}
If a frieze pattern has symmetry through translations and vertical
reflections, must it have symmetry through glide reflections?
\end{question}





\subsection*{Rotations}\index{rotations}

Finally, frieze patterns can have symmetry through $180^\circ$
rotations.
\[
\includegraphics{fprot.pdf}
\]

\begin{question}
Can you identify the frieze patterns below that have symmetry through
$180^\circ$ rotations?
\[
\includegraphics{fpfriezeRot.pdf}
\]
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Suppose you have a frieze pattern with symmetry through both glide
reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations. Must this pattern also have
symmetry through horizontal reflections?
\end{question}



\begin{question}
Imagine that you have a frieze pattern that has symmetry through
horizontal reflections and $180^\circ$ rotations, but not through
vertical reflections. Could the center of the rotation be on the
vertical line that defines the reflection?
\end{question}

I think I'll step in and give you a big hint. Consider the following
set of pictures and mysterious symbols:
\[
\includegraphics{friezeRotRefCent.pdf}
\]
\begin{question}
Can you explain what these pictures are trying to express?
\end{question}
