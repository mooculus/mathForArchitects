\begin{exercise}
  When jets fly above $8000$ meters in the air they form a vapor
  trail. Cruising altitude for a commercial airliner is around $10000$
  meters. One day I reached my arm into the sky and measured the
  length of the vapor trail with my hand---my hand could just span the
  entire trail. If my hand spans $9$ inches and my arm extends $25$
  inches from my eye, how long is the vapor trail?
  \[
  \answer{1451.61}~\text{meters}\quad\text{or}\quad\answer{4762.5}~\text{feet}
  \]
