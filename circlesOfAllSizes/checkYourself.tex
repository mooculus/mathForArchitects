\begin{exercise}
 Suppose you have an arc of a circle that is $10$ units long. If the
 arc makes an angle of $10$ degrees with the center of the circle,
 what is the circumference of the circle?
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
 Suppose you have a circle with a circumfrence of $300$ units. If an
 arc makes an angle of $60$ degrees with the center of the circle,
 what is the length of the arc?

\begin{exercise}
  Suppose Dr.\ Shapiro walks Phio counterclockwise along the star-path
  below, where each ``leg'' of the star is $100$ yards.  Phido stays
  exactly one yard to Dr.\ Shapiro's right at all times.
  \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \foreach \i in {1,...,7}
                 {
                   \draw ({2*sin(\i *360/7)},{2*cos(\i * 360/7)}) -- ({2*sin((\i+3)*360/(7))},{2*cos((\i+3)*360/(7))});
                   %\node (1) at ({1.3*sin(\i *360/7)},{1.3*cos(\i *360/7)}) {$\beta$};
                 }
                 
      \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  How much farther does Phido walk than
  Dr.\ Shapiro?

\begin{exercise}
Imagine a string, pulled tight around the planet Earth. Suppose you
add an extra $10''$ to the string. The string is then pulled away from
the Earth uniformly, all around the globe, as far as possible. How far
is that?
\end{exercise}
