%% \begin{question}
%%   I was reading some fancy math the other day, it said for any shape
%%   of area $A$, the perimeter of this shape is $P$ where:
%%   \[
%%   P \ge 2\pi\sqrt{A/\pi}
%%   \]
%%   Use the fact that a circle is the two dimensional shape of greatest
%%   area for a given perimeter to deduce the inequality above.
%%   \begin{hint} Recall $A = \pi r^2$ and $C = 2\pi r$.
%%   \end{hint}

\begin{question}
\textbf{Angles} and the \textbf{arc length} of a circle are closely
related. Suppose we have a circle and an angle is made:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[geometryDiagrams]
  \tkzDefPoint(0,0){O}
  \tkzDefPoint(4,0){A}
  \tkzDefPoint(4*cos(1),4*sin(1)){B}
  \tkzDrawArc[line width = 4,black](O,A)(B)
  \tkzDrawArc[](O,B)(A)
  \tkzDrawLines[add = 0 and .5](O,A O,B)
 % \tkzLablSegments[mark=|](O,A)
  \tkzDrawPoints(O,A,B)
  \tkzMarkAngle[size=0.75cm,mark=](A,O,B)
   \tkzLabelAngle[pos = .8,right](A,O,B){$\theta$}
 \end{tikzpicture}
 
\end{center}
Answer these questions:
\begin{enumerate}
%% \item If the thick segment has a length of $45$ units and the angle is $45^\circ$, what is the circumference of the circle?
%% \item If the thick segment has a length of $10$ units and the angle is $180^\circ$, what is the circumference of the circle?
%% \item If the thick segment has a length of $25$ units and the angle is $60^\circ$, what is the circumference of the circle?
%% \item If the thick segment has a length of $50$ units and the angle is $7^\circ$, what is the circumference of the circle?
  %% \item If the thick segment has a length of $x$ units and the angle is $\theta^\circ$, what is the circumference of the circle?
\item If the radius of the circle is $1$ unit, and $\theta=180^\circ$, what is the length of the thick segment?
\item If the radius of the circle is $1$ unit, and $\theta=270^\circ$, what is the length of the thick segment?
\item If the radius of the circle is $1$ unit, and $\theta=10^\circ$, what is the length of the thick segment?
\end{enumerate}
Now answer these questions \textbf{again}, but where the radius of the
circle is $r$ units.

\begin{question} %% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_girdling_Earth 
  %% Here a problem that is at least $300$ years old, so let's call it an  ``oldie, but a goodie!''
  %% \begin{quote}
  %%   Imagine a chain, pulled tight around the Earth's equator. Suppose
  %%   you add an extra $10'$ to the chain. The chain is then raised up
  %%   uniformly, all around the Earth, as high as possible. How high is
  %%   that?
  %% \end{quote}
  %% Supposing that
  %% \begin{itemize}
  %% \item There are $5280$ feet in a mile, and
  %% \item the radius of the Earth is $4000$ miles,
  %% \end{itemize}
  %% it is now time for you to try you hand at this classic.
  %% \begin{enumerate}
  %% \item Give a solution in feet. Show all work.
  %% \item Now solve the problem AGAIN but for a table that is $2'$ in
  %%   radius; that is imagine a chain, pulled tight around a circular
  %%   table. Suppose you add an extra $10'$ to the chain. The chain is
  %%   then pulled away uniformly, all around the table, as far as
  %%   possible. How far is that?
  %% \item Is the answer to the previous parts surprising? Explain why or
  %%   why not.
  %% \end{enumerate}
  %% \begin{freeResponse}
  %%   It is easiest to work with letters. If $R$ is the radius of the
  %%   circle, then we have
  %%   \begin{align*}
  %%     2\pi (R + d) &= 2\pi R +10,\\
  %%     2\pi R + 2\pi d &= 2\pi R + 10,\\
  %%     2\pi d &= 10,\\
  %%     d &= \frac{10}{2\pi}.
  %%   \end{align*}
  %% \end{freeResponse}

 
Dr.\ Shapiro walks his dog Phido every day. Phido stays exactly one
yard to Dr.\ Shapiro's right at all times.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose Dr.\ Shapiro walks counterclockwise on a circular path
  $100$ yards in diameter. How much farther does Phido walk than
  Dr.\ Shapiro? 
\item Suppose Dr.\ Shapiro walks counterclockwise on a square path
  that is $100$ yards along a side.  How much farther does Phido walk than
  Dr.\ Shapiro? 
\item Suppose Dr.\ Shapiro walks counterclockwise on a regular
  pentagonal path that is $100$ yards along a side.  How much farther does Phido walk than
  Dr.\ Shapiro? 
\end{enumerate}
In each case, show all work, explain your reasoning, and I really
encourage that you draw pictures to help.

\begin{question}
  The inner lane of a running track around a football field is four
  hundred meters in length.  Each lane after that is 1 yard farther
  out.  If the finish lines are the same, how should the starting line
  of each of the outer lanes be adjusted to make five lanes have equal
  length? Show all work and explain your reasoning, and again, I
  encourage you to draw pictures.
\end{question}
