\title{Logs for extremes}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
    We use logarithms to compare and visualize quantities that range
    across many orders of magnitude.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

\begin{listOutcomes}
    \item Recall the definition of the logarithm.
    \item Read and interpret log scales.
    \item Explore how log scales can help us compare vastly different numbers.
    \item Plot data on a log-scale.
\end{listOutcomes}

\begin{definition}
    We define the \textbf{logarithm} as
    \[
        \log_b(a) = x
        \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
        b^x = a.
    \]
\end{definition}

In everyday life (and in architecture, science, and economics!), we
often run into situations where numbers differ by factors of millions,
billions, or more. A \textbf{logarithmic} scale helps us see, plot,
and compare these extremes more easily.

% QUESTION 1: SHOW RICHTER SCALE, ASK ABOUT BASE, AND CONNECTION TO EXPONENTIAL GROWTH
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the
intensity of earthquakes.

% QUESTION 2: INTERPRETING LOG SCALES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
    The edge of the \emph{observable} universe is around $47$ billion
    light-years from Earth, which is an unfathomably large distance. However,
    if we use what is called a \textbf{log-scale} on the vertical axis, meaning
    we take some log (in this case $\log_{463}$) of the vertical values, we can
    easily visualize the data, behold:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[x=1.5cm,y=1cm]
            % A simple blank axis for the students to label
            \draw[thin,->] (-.5,0)--(10.5,0);
            \draw[thin,->] (0,-.5)--(0,10.5);
            % Example tick marks (unlabeled, for students to fill in)
            \foreach \y in {1,...,10}{

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Starting with the same first tick-mark, how tall would this plot
              be if we used a linear-scale instead of a log scale? Explain your reasoning.
        \item Starting with the same first tick-mark, how tall would this plot
              be if we used a $\log_2$-scale? Explain your reasoning.

% QUESTION 3: WEALTH DISTRIBUTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
In the United States, around $345$ million people have a net worth of less than $\$500$ million. In fact the median net worth of a family in the United States is around $\$100000$. 
 If we visit the following website:
\begin{center}
        %\texttt{http://www.righto.com/2024/10/wealth-distribution-in-united-states.html}
        \url{https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/}
    \end{center}
    we can see the net worth of the $400$ richest people in the United States.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Approximately what percentage of the population of the United States is $345$ million people?
        \item On a single \textbf{logarithmic-scale}, plot typical net of the wealtheist, 100th wealthest, 200th wealthest, 300 wealthest, 
        400 weathest person in the United States, along with $\$500000000$, and the median wealth of $\$100000$. Be sure to tell me the base of your logarithmic-scale.
              \begin{center}
              \begin{tikzpicture}[x=1.5cm,y=1cm]
                % A simple blank axis for the students to label
                \draw[thin,->] (-.5,0)--(10.5,0);
                \draw[thin,->] (0,-.5)--(0,10.5);
                % Example tick marks (unlabeled, for students to fill in)
                \foreach \y in {1,...,10}{
                        \draw (0,\y) -- ++(0.2,0);
                        %\node at (-1.5,\y) {$\log_{463}\left(463^{\y}\right)=\y$};
                        \node[anchor=east] at (-.1,\y) {$\y$};
                    }
                \end{tikzpicture}
                \end{center}
        \item Briefly discuss why it might be more intuitive to use a log scale
              than a linear scale when comparing a typical family's net worth
              to
              that of someone with \(\$200\) billion.
