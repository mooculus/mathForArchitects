    We use logarithms to compare and visualize quantities that range
    across many orders of magnitude.

\maketitle

\begin{listOutcomes}
    \item Recall the definition of the logarithm.
    \item Read and interpret log scales.
    \item Explore how log scales can help us compare vastly different numbers.
    \item Plot data on a log-scale.
\end{listOutcomes}

\begin{definition}
    We define the \textbf{logarithm} as
    \[
        \log_b(a) = x
        \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
        b^x = a.
    \]
\end{definition}

In everyday life (and in architecture, science, and economics!), we
often run into situations where numbers differ by factors of millions,
billions, or more. A \textbf{logarithmic} scale helps us see, plot,
and compare these extremes more easily.

% QUESTION 2: INTERPRETING LOG SCALES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
    The edge of the \emph{observable} universe is around $47$ billion
    light-years from Earth, which is an unfathomably large distance. However,
    if we use what is called a \textbf{log-scale} on the vertical axis, meaning
    we take some log (in this case $\log_{463}$) of the vertical values, we can
    easily visualize the data, behold:

% QUESTION 3: WEALTH DISTRIBUTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
    \textbf{Wealth Distribution: Comparing Everyday Net Worth to Extreme
        Fortunes}

    According to data compiled at
    \begin{center}
        \texttt{http://www.righto.com/2024/10/wealth-distribution-in-united-states.html},
    \end{center}
    net worth in the United States varies widely, from a median of
    roughly \(\$100{,}000\) to the \(\$200\) billion range for some of the
    richest individuals (e.g., Elon Musk).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item On a single \textbf{logarithmic-scale}, plot typical net worth
              amounts such as:
              \[
                  \$1{,}000,\quad \$100{,}000,\quad \$1{,}000{,}000,\quad
                  \$1{,}000{,}000{,}000,\quad
                  \$200{,}000{,}000{,}000.
              \]
              Use the blank axis below and add your own labels or ticks as
              needed.

        \item Briefly discuss why it might be more intuitive to use a log scale
              than a linear scale when comparing a typical family's net worth
              to
              that of someone with \(\$200\) billion.
    \end{enumerate}

% QUESTION 3: DISCOVER THE RICHTER SCALE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
    \textbf{Richter Scale for Earthquakes READING?}

    Earthquake magnitudes are often reported using the (common) logarithm
    base \(10\). For instance, a magnitude \(M\) earthquake satisfies
    \[
        M = \log_{10}\!\Bigl(\tfrac{A}{A_0}\Bigr),
    \]
    where \(A\) is the measured seismic wave amplitude and \(A_0\) is a
    standard reference amplitude.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Suppose an earthquake measures \(M=7\). By what factor is its
              seismic wave amplitude \(A\) bigger than the reference amplitude
              \(A_0\)?

        \item If another earthquake measures \(M=8\), how many times larger is
              \emph{its} amplitude compared to the \(M=7\) quake?

        \item Draw an axis below to illustrate how quickly earthquake
              amplitudes grow as \(M\) increases. Label some hypothetical
              magnitudes (like 2, 5, 7, 9) along the axis.

    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[x=1cm,y=1cm,scale=0.8]
            % A simple blank axis for the students to label

            \foreach \x in {0,...,10}
