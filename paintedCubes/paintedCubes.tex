\begin{question}
  Suppose you have a cube with two colors, red and blue. If you paint
  each face red or blue, how many \textbf{different} cubes can be created?
  Explain your reasoning with pictures, words and so on.

  Suppose you have a cube painted with all six colors: red, orange,
  yellow, green, blue, violet. If you paint each face a different one
  of these colors how many \textbf{different} cubes can be created?
  Explain your reasoning with pictures, words and so on.

\begin{question}
  Suppose you have $8$ cubes, all the same size. Two are red, two are
  blue, two are yellow, and two are green. These 8 cubes can be put
  together to form a larger cube where each face of the larger cube
  shows every color. Without building a model, how many
  \textbf{different} larger cubes can be formed with these $8$ cubes?
  Explain your reasoning with pictures, words and so on.
\end{question}
