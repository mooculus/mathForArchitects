\begin{exercise}
  Suppose I have a window $50''$ tall that is $20''$ from the
  ceiling. If $\theta$ is the solar angle, and $\tan(\theta) = .5$,
  what's the longest the overhang can be while still letting sunlight
  through the entire window?
\end{exercise}

  Suppose I have a window $50''$ tall that is $20''$ from the ceiling.
  If $\theta$ is the solar angle, and $\tan(\theta) = 2$, what's the
  longest the overhang can be while still letting sunlight through the
  entire window?
