\begin{enumerate}
  \item[Getting started:] We make estimates of every-day objects in
    every-day settings and we observe the effects of scaling when we
    change objects.
  \item[Area of triangles:] We build a formula for the area of a
    triangle based on the area of a rectangle and observe
    relationships between perimeter and area.
  \item[Volume of pyramids:] We build a formula for the volume of a
    pyramid based on the volume of a box and observe relationships
    between surface area and volume.
  \item[Roof area estimates:] We make estimates with given measurements
    and start to determine what is, and is not, a reasonable estimate.
  \item[Formulas galore:] We make estimates using basic formulas and
    determine what is, and is not, a reasonable estimate.
\end{enumerate}
