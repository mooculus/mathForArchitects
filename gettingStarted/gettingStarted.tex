  We make estimates of numbers of objects in every-day settings and we
  observe the effects of scaling when we change objects.

\begin{question}
  Here's a scale picture of a large \textit{Happy Fun Ball}:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  % Define the radius of the circle (half of the diameter)
  \def\ballradius{4.7cm} % 

  % Draw the circle
  \draw[ultra thick] (0, 0) circle (\ballradius);

  % You can add additional elements or labels here if needed
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
Look around our classroom. How many large \textit{Happy Fun Balls}
would it take to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Line one edge of the classroom?
 \item Cover the floor?
 \item Fill the room?
\end{enumerate}
In each case, EXPLAIN how you arrive at your conclusion.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Small \textit{Happy Fun Balls} have a about one-third the diameter of a large \textit{Happy Fun Ball}. How many small \textit{Happy Fun Balls} would it take to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Line one edge of the classroom?
\item Cover the floor?
\item Fill the room?
\end{enumerate}
In each case,  EXPLAIN how you arrive at your conclusion.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Your friend and fellow student \textit{Geometry Giorgio} suggests
  that we think in the following way:
\begin{quote}
  Since a large \textit{Happy Fun Ball} has about three times the
  diameter of a small \textit{Happy Fun Ball,} the answers for Problem
  $2$ above should all be about three times the answers from Problem
  $1$.
\end{quote}
Is \textit{Geometry Giorgio} correct?  If he is correct, explain
why. If he is not correct, explain how you know he is not correct. 
\end{question}
