\item Begin to think about exponential growth.
\item Critique and dismantle reasonable hypotheses in regard to
  geometry and arithmetic.
\item Reason from a table to induce a formula.
\item Use algebra to show a formula is true.
\item Use insight to approximate computations.

Again, literally repeating ourselves: It is difficult to grasp the
size of large numbers without a context that seems real to us. We'll
use the context of ``cold, hard, cash'' and the ``cruel curse of
time'' to help us understand the magnitude of numbers.  Dream this
daydream with me:

  \textbf{Pennies-a-day Daydream:}\\
  Suppose you were paid the following way: Just a penny on your first
  day, double that (two pennies) the next, double that (four pennies)
  the next, and so on, each day doubling the payment amount.

Let's think about this seemingly impossible situation.

\begin{question}
  Assume you are collecting money through the impossible situation
  above.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item How much money would you collect in the first week? Show your
    work.
  \item \textit{Geometry Giorgio} suggest that in two weeks you would
    collect
    \[
    (\text{amount from first week}) + 2\cdot (\text{amount from first
      week})
    \]
    Is he correct? If he is correct, explain why. If he is not
    correct, explain why and give a correct analysis.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item In one week, I'd collect
      \[
      0.01+0.02+0.04+0.08+0.16+0.32+0.64 = 1.27
      \]
      dollars.

\begin{question}
  One way to conceptualize data is with a table. Fill in the table
  below:
\[
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  \text{Day}       & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\ \hline\hline
  \text{Collected} & \phantom{1023} & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}  & \phantom{1023}   \\ \hline
  \text{Total}     &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &   &    \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]
\begin{freeResponse}
  Here is my table:
  \[
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  \text{Day}       & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\ \hline\hline
  \text{Collected} & 0.01  & 0.02  & 0.04  & 0.08 & 0.16& 0.32& 0.64& 1.28 & 2.56  & 5.12   \\ \hline
  \text{Total}     & 0.01  & 0.03  & 0.07  & 0.15  & 0.31  & 0.63  & 1.27  & 2.55  & 5.11  & 10.23   \\ \hline

\begin{question}
  Now we need to REFLECT on our work to unlease the secret of this growth.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Use your table above to guess a for the total amount
      collected from day $1$ to day $n$. Explain how you found your
      guess USING THE TABLE.
    \item Use ALGEBRAIC REASONING to EXPLAIN WHY your formula is true.
    \item Use the fact that after $10$ days, you have approximately
      $\$10$ to EXPLAIN how to MENTALLY approximate, how much was
      collected in the first $20$ days WITHOUT a calculator.
      \begin{hint}
        Consider the fact that $2^10 \approx 1000$ and :
        \[
        2^{20} = \left(2^{10}\right)^2
        \]
      \end{hint}
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item From the table, it looks like the amount collected from
        day $1$ to day $n$ is equal to how much you'll collect on the
        next day minus one. Since on day $n$ we collect $.01\cdot
        2^n$, we guess:
        \[
        \mathrm{Total}(n) = 0.01\cdot 2^{n} -0.01
        \]
      \item To see why this is true with algebra, write
        \begin{align*}
        \mathrm{Total}(n) &= 0.01 +0.01\cdot 2+0.01\cdot 2^2 +0.01 \cdot 2^3 + \dots + 0.01 \cdot 2^{n-1}\\
        &= 0.01 + 2 ( 0.01 +0.01\cdot 2+0.01\cdot 2^2 +0.01 \cdot 2^3 + \dots + 0.01 \cdot 2^{n-2})\\
        &= 0.01 + 2 ( \mathrm{Total}(n) - 0.01\cdot 2^{n-1})\\
        &= 0.01 + 2\cdot\mathrm{Total}(n) - 0.01\cdot 2^{n}
        \end{align*}
        Now we have:
        \[
        \mathrm{Total}(n)= 0.01 + 2\cdot\mathrm{Total}(n) - 0.01\cdot 2^{n}
        \]
    Solving for $\mathrm{Total}(n)$ we find
    \[
    \mathrm{Total}(n) = 0.01\cdot 2^{n} -0.01.
    \]
  \item Well the first $2$ weeks is $14$ days. So we've collected 
    \begin{align*}
      \mathrm{Total}(n) &= .01\cdot 2^{20} - .01\\
        &\approx .01 \left(2^{10}\right)^2 \\
      &\approx .01 \cdot 1000^2 \\
      &\approx 10^{-2} \cdot 10^6 \\
        &= 10^4 = 10000~\text{dollars} 
    \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}
