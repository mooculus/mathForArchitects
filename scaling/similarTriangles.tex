In geometry, we may have several different segments all with the same
length. We don't want to say that the segments are \textit{equal}
because that would mean that they are \textit{exactly} the
same---position included. Hence we need a new concept:

\begin{definition}\index{congruent!segments}
When different segments have the same length, we say they are
\textbf{congruent segments}. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\index{congruent!angles}
In a similar fashion, if there is an isometry that maps one angle to another angle, then we say they are \textbf{congruent angles}.
\end{definition}

Putting these together, we have the definition for triangles:

\begin{definition}\index{congruent!triangles} 
Two triangles are said to be \textbf{congruent triangles} if there is
an isometry that maps one triangle to the other triangle.
\end{definition}


After working with triangles for short time, one quickly sees that the
notion of congruence is not the only ``equivalence'' one wants to
make between triangles. In particular, we want the notion of
\textit{similarity.} \index{similar triangles}

One day when aloof old Professor Rufus was trying to explain similar
triangles to his class, he merely wrote
\[
\tri ABC \sim \tri A'B'C' \qquad\Leftrightarrow \qquad\begin{array}{l}
\angle A \simeq \angle A'\\
\angle B \simeq \angle B' \\
\angle C \simeq \angle C'
\end{array}
\]
and walked out of the room.

\begin{question} 
Can you give three much needed examples of similar triangles? 
\end{question}

%% Devise a way to use folding and tracing constructions to help explore this notion

Another day when aloof old Professor Rufus was trying to explain
similar triangles to his class, he merely wrote
\[
\tri ABC \sim \tri A'B'C' \qquad\Leftrightarrow \qquad
\begin{array}{l}
AB = k\cdot A'B'\\
BC = k\cdot B'C' \\
CA = k\cdot C'A'
\end{array}
\]
and walked out of the room.

\begin{question} 
What's going on in aloof old Professor Rufus' head\footnote{I realize that
this is a dangerous question!}---why are his explanations so different?
\end{question}


In fact, the two definitions of similar triangles given
above are \textbf{equivalent}.


\begin{definition}\index{similar triangles} 
Two triangles $\tri ABC$ and $\tri A'B'C'$ are said to be
\textbf{similar} if either equivalent condition holds:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\angle A \simeq \angle A'\\
\angle B \simeq \angle B' \\
\angle C \simeq \angle C'
\end{array}
\qquad\text{or}\qquad
\begin{array}{l}
AB = k\cdot A'B'\\
BC = k\cdot B'C' \\
CA = k\cdot C'A'
\end{array}
\]
\end{definition}

Let's see if we can put similar triangles to work. Here is an old
carpenter's trick. Suppose you have two parallel lines.  
\[
\includegraphics{twoLinesCarp.pdf}
\]
If you want to make two more lines that divide the space into three
equal regions, you can place a ruler diagonally across the parallel
lines, and then mark off one-third of the diagonal distance. 
\[
\includegraphics{twoLinesCarpRulers.pdf}
\]
From this you get your three regions.
\[

\]
\begin{question}
Can you explain why this works using similar triangles?
\end{question}


Now for a more challenging situation.  Suppose we have an equilateral
triangle of side length $2$. Use similar triangles and the Pythagorean
Theorem to find the length of the segment $a$ (the segment that goes
from the \textbf{center} of the triangle to a side at a right angle)
in the picture below.
\[
\includegraphics{triangleSegment.pdf}
\]
\begin{question}
How do you do this?
\end{question}
