   During a solar eclipse we see that the apparent diameter of the
  Sun and Moon are nearly equal. If the Moon is around $24000$ miles
  from Earth, the Moon's diameter is about $2000$ miles, and the Sun's
  diameter is about $865000$ miles, how far is the Sun from the Earth?
  \[
  \answer{10380000}~\text{miles}
