\begin{exercise}
  When jets fly above $8000$ meters in the air they form a vapor
  trail. Cruising altitude for a commercial airliner is around $10000$
  meters from the ground. One day I reached my arm into the sky and
  measured the length of the vapor trail with my hand---my hand could
  just span the entire trail. If my hand spans $9$ inches and my arm
  extends $25$ inches from my eye, how long is the vapor trail?
