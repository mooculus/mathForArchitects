\begin{exercise}
  I was walking down Woody Hayes Drive, standing in front of
  St.\ John Arena when a car pulled up and the driver asked, ``Where
  is Ohio Stadium?'' At this point I was a bit perplexed, but
  nevertheless I answered, ``Do you see the enormous concrete building
  on the other side of the street that looks like the Roman Colosseum?
  That's it.''
 
The person in the car then asked, ``Where are the Twin-Towers then?''
Looking up, I realized that the towers were in fact just covered by the
top of Ohio Stadium. I told the driver to just drive around the
stadium until they found two enormous identical towers---that would be
them. They thanked me and I suppose they met their destiny.

I am about 2 meters tall, I was standing about 100 meters from the
Ohio Stadium, and Ohio Stadium is about 40 meters tall. If the Towers
are around 500 meters from the rotunda (the front entrance of the
stadium), how tall could they be and still be obscured by the stadium?
\[
\answer{230}~\text{meters}
\]
For the record, the towers are about 80 meters tall.
