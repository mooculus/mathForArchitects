  You love IMAX movies. While the typical IMAX screen is 72 feet
  by 53 feet, your TV only has a 32 inch screen---it has a 32 inch
  diagonal. How close do you have to sit to your screen to simulate
  the IMAX format?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If you sit $25$ feet from the screen at the theater, you
      must sit $\answer{800/\sqrt{7993}}$ inches away from the TV at home.
    \item If you sit $100$ feet from the screen at the theater, you
      must sit $\answer{3200/\sqrt{7993}}$ inches away from the TV at home.
  \end{itemize}
