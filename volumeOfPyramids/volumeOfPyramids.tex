\begin{question}
  Let us work analogously to what we did in the triangle case.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Use your work above to derive a formula for the volume of a
    right square-based pyramid whose height is $s$ with an $s\times s$
    square base. Explain your reasoning.
  \item State Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions. Explain what Cavalieri's principle means using words, pictures etc.
  \item Give a formula for the volume of \emph{any} (not necessarily
    ``right'') pyramid of height $s$ over an $s\times s$ square
    base. Explain your reasoning.
  % \item Explain how to use a picture to prove that a pyramid of a
  %   given (fixed) volume could have an arbitrarily large surface area.
  \item What if the base of the pyramid is $s\times s$ but the height is $h$? What's the volume now?
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{freeResponse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The volume of a cube is $s^3$. Since $3$ right pyramids make up
    this cube, a right pyramid of side length $s$ and height $s$ must
    have a volume of:
    \[
    \frac{s^3}{3}
    \]
    \item Here we break up the $a\times b\times h$ box into 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}
\mynewpage

\begin{question}
  Let's extend these ideas further:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Now consider a pyramid of height $h$ with an $1\times 2$
    rectangular base. Use your work above (and the distributive
    property) to derive a formula for the volume of this
    pyramid in terms of the area of the rectangle. Explain your reasoning with words, pictures and such.
    \item Now consider a pyramid of height $h$ with an $2\times 6$
    rectangular base. Use your work above (and the distributive
    property) to derive a formula for the volume of this
    pyramid in terms of the area of the reactangle. Explain your reasoning with words, pictures and such.
  \item Finally, consider a cone of height $h$ over a blobby shape of
    area $A$. Use your previous work to derive a formula for the
    volume of this solid in terms of the area $A$ and the height. Explain your reasoning with words, pictures and such.
    \begin{hint}
      Start by chopping the blobby shape into little squares. Then use your previous ideas.
    \end{hint}
