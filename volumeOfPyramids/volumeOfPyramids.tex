\title{Volume of pyramids}

\author{Jenny Sheldon \and Bart Snapp}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  We build a formula for the volume of a pyramid based on the volume
  of a box and observe relationships between surface area and volume.

\begin{question}
  Give detailed diagrams with explanation showing that a cube can be
  constructed from three identical square-based pyramids.

\begin{question} 
  Use your work above to derive a formula for the volume of an
  individual pyramid from the previous problem. Assume that the height
  is $s$ with an $s\times s$ square base.
  \begin{freeResponse}
    The volume of a cube is $s^3$. Since $3$ right pyramids make up
    this cube, a right pyramid of side length $s$ and height $s$ must
    have a volume of:
    \[
    \frac{s^3}{3}
    \]
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Let us work analogously to what we did in the triangle case.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item State Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions. Explain what Cavalieri's principle means using words, pictures etc.
  \item Give a formula for the volume of \emph{any} pyramid of height $s$ over an $s\times
    s$ square base.
 % \item Give a formula for the volume of \emph{any} pyramid of height
 %   $s$ over a base of area $A$.
  \end{enumerate}
    \begin{freeResponse}
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item In three dimensions, Cavalieri's principle states:
        \begin{quote}
          Shearing parallel to a fixed direction does not change the
          volume of a three dimensional object.
        \end{quote}
      \item Easy, just shear the pyramid! By Cavalieri it must have
        the same volume as a right pyramid. Hence it is still $s^3/3$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{freeResponse}
