\begin{question}
  New math is being created all the time. Here are two DIFFICULT math
  problems that were ``recently'' solved:
  \begin{description}
    \item[Four Color Problem:] Imagine you have a map of a country or a
      region, and you want to color it in a way that no two neighboring
      areas (like states or counties) have the same color. This means
      that if two areas share a border, they must be colored
      differently. How few colors does it take?
    \item[Einstein Tiling Problem:] Is there a single shape that tessellates
      the plane but with no possible repeating patterns?
  \end{description}
  When were they solved? Why is it called the ``four color'' problem? Why is it
  called the ``einstein tiling'' problem?
\end{question}

\mynewpage

\begin{question}
  Here is a tiling with the \textbf{spectre}.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=.9]{spectre.png}
  \end{center}
  Make this BEAUTIFUL by coloring it in with as \textbf{few colors as
    possible} and \textbf{no adjacent tiles having the same color.}
\end{question}

\mynewpage

\begin{question}
  Here is a tiling with the \textbf{hat}, and its reflection:
  \begin{center}
    left-bump hat~\raisebox{-1em}{\includegraphics[scale=.8]{lrHat.png}}
    right-bump hat
  \end{center}
  The left-bump hat is less common than the right-bump hat on the in
  the tiling below:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=.8]{hat.png}
  \end{center}
  Make this BEAUTIFUL by coloring it in with as \textbf{few colors as
    possible, no adjacent tiles having the same color, and with
    all of the the left-bump hats the SAME color.} What do you
  think, is the ``hat'' an einstein tile? EXPLAIN the reason for your
  decision.
\end{question}
