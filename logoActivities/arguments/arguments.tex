  Let me remind you how to draw a regular $n$-gon \lc{repeat :n [ fd
      :s rt 360/:n ]}, where \lc{:n} and \lc{:s} are variables that
  YOU are supposed to fill in. Variables that friends are supposed to
  provide are called \dfn{arguments}.  We can make \LOGO\ functions
  with arguments easily. As a gesture of friendship, let me present you with \lc{reg.n.gon :n :s}
\begin{logo}
to reg.n.gon :n :s
  repeat :n [ fd :s rt 360/:n ]
end
\end{logo}
With that code, we can use \lc{reg.n.gon 3 200} to make an equilateral
triangle. In fact we can do something \emph{really cool} we can
write new functions \textit{in terms of this function.} For example:
\begin{logo}
to eq.tri :s reg.n.gon 3 :s end
to square :s reg.n.gon 4 :s end
to circle reg.n.gon 360 1.74538 end
\end{logo}

\section{Loading programs}

Once you have a file with all of these functions, we can load these
functions into \emph{any} \LOGO\ activity with the \lc{include}
command. Here's how it works, every Turtle Academy program has a
unique URL that looks something like:
\[
\texttt{https://turtleacademy.com/programs/12345}
\]
to load this program in another program, you simply do something like:
\begin{logo}
include 12345
square 100  
\end{logo}
and the program associated to ``12345'' will be loaded, and you can
then use the functions within.


\section{Many variables}

We could also make a (very basic) \lc{cannon} command. Check this out:

\begin{logo}
to cannon :h :f :r :t
seth 90 rt -:h
setwidth 10
  repeat :t [
    setcolor 5*repcount/:t
    fd :f rt :r ]
end
\end{logo}
Note, this function has \textsc{four} arguments. We can see the flight
of a ``cannon ball'' with this function as \lc{cannon 60 3 1 120} produces:
\begin{logoout}
  \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{cannon.png}
\end{logoout}
You may wonder, where did the cannon ball land? You can use \lc{print
  xcor} and \lc{print ycor} to figure this out.


\section{Commands to know}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  \lc{CMD}   & Description      & Example           \\ \hlinewd{1pt}
  \lc{include \#} & input a library & \lc{include 12345} \\
  \lc{xcor} & horizontal position & \lc{print xcor} \\
  \lc{ycor}     & vertical position & \lc{print ycor}\\
  \lc{heading} & current heading  & \lc{print heading}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
  Make a new program and call it \lc{Library}.  Add our functions
  \lc{reg.n.gon}, \lc{eq.tri}, \lc{square}, \lc{circle} to your
  library. Add \emph{two} new routines that make basic shapes to your program
  \lc{Library}. Show-off your work with your code and a picture. 
\end{problem}

\mynewpage

\begin{problem}
  Enhance your program \lc{circle} so that it has its radius as an input,
  and will draw a circle of radius \lc{:r}.  Use \lc{print},
  \lc{xcor}, and \lc{ycor} to show that your code works. Show-off your
  work with your code and a picture.
\end{problem}

\mynewpage


\begin{problem}
  Make an \lc{rainbow :w} command that will make a rainbow of a given
  width centered around a point.
\end{problem}

\mynewpage

\begin{problem}
  Make an \lc{arrow :h :l :p} command that will take a heading
  \lc{:h}, a length for the arrow shaft \lc{:l}, and \lc{:p} will give
  the size of the pointy-end.  Show-off your work with your code and a
  picture.
\end{problem}

\mynewpage

\begin{problem}
  Imagine a ``cannon'' is sitting at $(0,0)$ and that there is a
  ``target'' at $(150,0)$. Use \lc{print xcor} to hit the target with
  \lc{cannon 60 :f 1 120} by modifying \lc{:f}.

  \emph{Keep track of how many attempts it takes you to hit the target
    to within one decimal place.}

  Present your attempts as data, with \emph{Attempt number}, \lc{:f},
  \lc{xcor} as headings.
\end{problem}
