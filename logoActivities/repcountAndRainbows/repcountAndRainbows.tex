The command \lc{repeat} might seem pretty cool, but it really comes
alive when you combine it with \lc{repcount}. On the $i$th repetition
of a \lc{repeat} command, the command \lc{repcount} produces the number
$i$. We can use the command \lc{print} to witness this:
\begin{logo}
repeat 10 [ print repcount ]
\end{logo}
This produces a list of numbers, $1$--$10$. The command \lc{print} is
used to figure out values in programs while you write them.  Using
\lc{repcount} we can produce some really cool drawings, especially
when combined with the command \lc{\%}, that means ``take the
remainder,'' like in long division.

\begin{logo}
ht setcolor 0 fill rt 17
repeat 45 [ 
  setwidth .2*repcount 
  setcolor repcount % 15 + 1 
  fd repcount * 15 rt 144 ]
\end{logo}

\begin{logoout}
  \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{superStar.png}
\end{logoout}


Now we will use \lc{repeat} and \lc{repcount} to produce a picture of
the Sun.
\begin{logo}
ht setcolor [ 10 10 30 ] fill
to rays
  repeat 12 [ pu fd 120 pd
  repeat 100 [
    setwidth 14-14*repcount/(100) fd 1.2 ]
  pu bk 240 rt 30 ]
end
repeat 6 [ rt 41
  setcolor pick [ 4 6 14 ] rays ]
setcolor 6
filled 6 [ circle ]
\end{logo}
If you remember to define \lc{circle}, it makes:
\begin{logoout}
  \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{sun.png}
\end{logoout}


\section{Commands to know}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  \lc{CMD}   & Description                 \\ \hlinewd{1pt}
  \lc{repcount} & tells you which repetition  \\
  \lc{print \#}     & prints \lc{\#}\\
  \lc{:n \% :d} & remainder of \lc{:n} divided by \lc{:d}

\begin{problem}
  Above, we introduce the command \lc{\%} but we do not explain it
  very well. Can you explain the command \lc{\%}? Note, this command
  is sometimes called ``mod.''
\end{problem}

\mynewpage

\begin{problem}
  Sometimes you want \textit{nested} repcounts.  Use \lc{repcount} to
  help you make a command that will make rainbows.  Show-off your work
  with your code and a picture.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Create a picture involving a rainbow, clouds, and the Sun in the
  sky. Show-off your work with your code and a picture.

  Here's some code I found lying around the interwebs:
\begin{logo}
repeat 100 [
  fd repcount * 2 rt 91 ]
\end{logo}
  Use \lc{repcount} to help you make it awesome! Show-off your work
  with your code and a picture.
