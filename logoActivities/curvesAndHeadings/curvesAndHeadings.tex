  So far, we've been drawing polygons. We can draw a regular $n$-gon
  with
\begin{logo}
  repeat :n [ fd :s rt 360/:n ]
\end{logo}
where the character \lc{:n} represents the number of sides of the
regular $n$-gon and \lc{:s} represents the side-length of the regular
polygon. Both \lc{:n} and \lc{:s} are \emph{numbers} that you should
\emph{fill-in}. So for example, \lc{repeat 17 [ fd 20 rt 360/17 ]}, draws
\begin{logoout}
\begin{tikzpicture}[turtle/distance=.3cm]
  \draw [thick,black,turtle={home,forward,right=21,fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
      fd,right=21,
  }];
  \node at (0,0) {\turtle};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{logoout}
So one way to draw a ``circle'' is by making a regular $n$-gon with
many sides. So something like \lc{repeat 360 [fd :s rt 1]} for some
number \lc{:s}. As a gesture of friendship, I offer you:
\begin{logo}
to circle
pu rt 90 bk 100 lt 90 pd
repeat 360 [fd 1.74538 rt 1]
pu rt 90 fd 100 lt 90 pd
end
\end{logo}
This program draws a ``circle'' of radius $100$ around the point you
start at. The value $1.74538$ was found by trial-and-error.


Now that we can draw a ``circle,'' we can use \lc{seth \#} to set the
heading of the turtle to different points on the circle. Basically
\lc{seth \#} points the turtle at a heading of \lc{\#} degrees when
measured from the \emph{top of the circle} in a \emph{clockwise
  direction}. This is especially useful if you have a shape that needs
to be the same orientation every time. Check out this starry night.

\begin{logo}
to star 
  filled 7 [
    seth 90
    repeat 5 [ fd 50 rt 144 ]
  ]
end

ht setcolor [10 10 50] fill setcolor 7 pu
repeat 10 [ pu
  rt random 50 + 20 fd random 200 + 100
  pd star ]
\end{logo}
\emph{Note:} The stars are all at the same orientation, all thanks to \lc{seth}.
\begin{logoout}

\end{logoout}

\newpage

\begin{problem}
  Draw and label a picture (by hand or using a computer) showing how
  \lc{seth \#} points the turtle.
\end{problem}

\mynewpage

\begin{problem}
  \emph{First:}  Explain in words what the \lc{circle} program is doing line-by-line.


  \emph{Second:} Based on the \lc{circle} program above, make a new program
  \lc{circle.200} that will draw a circle of radius $200$ centered at
  the origin. Don't get freaked out by the \lc{.} in \lc{circle.200},
  it's just part of the name. Show-off your work with your code and a
  picture.
\end{problem}

\mynewpage


\begin{problem}
  The following code produces a simple ``house.''
\begin{logo}
filled 3 [ repeat 4 [ rt 90 fd 50 ] ]
filled 4 [ rt 30 fd 50 rt 120 fd 50 ]
\end{logo}
Modify this code so that the house is $\approx 50$ units tall, the
colors are randomized, and the house can be moved \emph{without} its
orientation changing. Call this function \lc{house}. Show-off your
work with your code and a picture.
\end{problem}

\mynewpage

\begin{problem}
  Use your command \lc{house} to make a command \lc{village} that will
  place three small houses on a green circle. Show-off your work with
  your code and a picture.
\end{problem}

\mynewpage

\begin{problem}
  Use your command \lc{village} to make a command \lc{country} that
  will place $5$ villages on a green background, with the villages
  connected by roads. Make sure that the roads don't pass through the
  houses! Show-off your work with your code and a picture.
\end{problem}
