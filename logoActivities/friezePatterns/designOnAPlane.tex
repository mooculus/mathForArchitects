Congratulations! The \mooculus\ Symmetry Squad is impressed by you
preliminary work on frieze patterns. They have a new job for you (again
for points, not cash). Remember how there are $7$ groups of symmetries
for the frieze patters? Well there are $17$ groups of symmetries of
wallpaper patterns. Let's talk about these symmetries.
  

If you have a repeating wallpaper pattern, most folks will agree
it must have at least \emph{two} translational symmetries that are in
\emph{different} directions. Check out my \LOGO:
\begin{logo}
to wallpaper.tt repeat 6 [
pu setxy -240 350-100*repcount seth 90 pd 
repeat 6 [ minimal.cell.t pu fd 100 pd ] ]
end
\end{logo}
Here \lc{minimal.cell.t} is also from our previous work. If you run \lc{wallpaper.tt}, this
produces:
\begin{logoout}
  \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{wallpapertt.png}
\end{logoout}
The pattern above has symmetry through a vertical translation and a
horizontal translation, hence \emph{two} translations in
\emph{different} directions. There are also other translations, but
those can be thought of as combos of our vertical and horizontal
translations.  Note these two patterns:
\[
\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{wallpapertt.png}}\quad \text{and} \quad\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{wallpapertt2.png}}
\]
have the \emph{same} symmetry group, though \emph{two translations}.

As a gesture of friendship, I present you with one more wallpaper
pattern with a different group of symmetries:
\begin{logo}
to wallpaper.ttg repeat 6 [
pu setxy -240 350-100*repcount seth 90 pd 
repeat 3 [
  minimal.cell.g pu fd 100 pd ] ]
end
\end{logo}
\begin{logoout}
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{wallpaperttg.png}
\end{logoout}

\begin{problem}
  Use \lc{basic.cell :f} to make programs \lc{minimal.cell.X} and
  \lc{wallpaper.Y}, to produce one wallpaper pattern for each possible
  wallpaper symmetry. There are $15$ additional symmetry groups of
  wallpaper patterns. In each case:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Display your code. 
  \item Display the output.
  \item List the symmetries of the given wallpaper pattern.
  \end{enumerate}
  As a gesture of friendship, the possible symmetries are: two
  translations (every wallpaper pattern will have these), one/two
  glide reflections, one/two reflectional symmetry, one/two rotational symmetries.
