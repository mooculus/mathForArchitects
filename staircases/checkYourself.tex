%% Staircases
%% Whole number of stairs, staircase must fit in the space. 


\begin{exercise}
  True or False: It is always possible to build a staircase of length $w$ and height $h$ that is to code. 
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
   True or False: \textbf{All} of the steps of determining the dimensions of a staircase are:
   
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Divide the total staircase height by the desired riser height, which give the total number of stairs,
 \item Divide the total staircase length by the total number of stairs, which will give the tread width,
 \item Use the desired riser height to construct the staircase
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} True or False: 
 For a staircase of height $300\ cm$, we would like to have risers that as close as possible to $18\ cm$. We should then have $17\ stairs$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} True or False: 
 For a staircase of height $300\ cm$ with $17\ stairs$, the risers will be exactly $18\ cm$ tall.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} True or False: 
  If a staircase satisfies Blondel's formula, then it must be up to code.
\end{exercise}
