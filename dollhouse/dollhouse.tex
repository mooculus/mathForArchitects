\begin{listOutcomes}
\item Apply the constructions from our class.
\item Invent new instructions when needed.
\item Create a plan an carry it through.
\item Disseminate basic mathematical knowledge.
\end{listOutcomes}

Since you've done such great work, you've again been hired (for
points, not hard cash) by the \mooculus\ design company. You see,
now they want someone to design a dollhouse in \snap\ for them.

The dollhouse must have:
\begin{itemize}
\item A reasonable scale ($1'=20$ pixels) and a STAGE of between $360000$
  square pixels and $640000$ square pixels.
\item A plan, or draft, that is drawn and followed along with an
  EXPLANATION of how you used concepts, tools, and so on, from this
  class.
\item At least three rooms. 
\item At least $1$ roof of a given pitch.
\item At least two different sized staircases.
\end{itemize}
For $2$ points extra credit, you could add pets and furniture. But
above all else, \textbf{use the concepts and the BLOCKS from this
  class to draw the dollhouse and EXPLAIN HOW YOU DO THIS.} Show off
your work by showing your PLAN, EXPLAINING how you meet the
requirements of the assignment, and a picture of your final STAGE.

  So I chose a scale of $20$ pixels per foot and a Stage of $800\times
  600$ pixels ($480000$ square pixels). My plan is below:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{dollhousePlan.pdf}
  \end{center}
  Note that real wall thickness is between $4''$ and $6''$, so I'll
  use $10$ pixels. The ground is at $y=-170$. I used a modified
  bisection method to get the first floor flooring correct. I used an
  ASA block to make the roof. I used the bisection method to find a
  pitch that would work for my plan, and then used a pitch of
  $9/12$. The bisection method was repeatedly used to correct minor
  overlap with the walls/floors.

  Here is my Stage:
